The Go Programming Language Specification
=========================================

Version of March 10, 2022
-------------------------

简介
------------

这是 GO 语言的参考手册，如果要查看 1.18 以前的版本，没有泛型的，请查看[这里](https://go.dev/doc/go1.17_spec.html)。更详细的信息和文档，请查看 [golang.org](https://go.dev/)。

Go 是一种设计时考虑了系统编程，强类型的， 自动垃圾回收并支持并发编程的通用编程语言。它的程序是由包(package)组成的，这样便于管理程序的依赖。

Go 语言的语法紧凑而简单，可通过集成开发环境等自动工具轻松进行分析。

表达方式
--------

它的语法是通过 Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) 表达的：
```go
Production  = production_name "=" [ Expression ] "." .
Expression  = Alternative { "|" Alternative } .
Alternative = Term { Term } .
Term        = production_name | token [ "…" token ] | Group | Option | Repetition .
Group       = "(" Expression ")" .
Option      = "[" Expression "]" .
Repetition  = "{" Expression "}" .
```

它的表达式是由特定语句和下列操作符组合而成的，以优先级递增排列：

```go
|   alternation
()  grouping
[]  option (0 or 1 times)
{}  repetition (0 to n times)
```

小写表达式表示文字字符，没有拆分的语句要以 CamelCase 书写，文字字符要使用双引号 `""` 或反引号 ` `` `。

书写方式 `a … b` 表示字母从 `a` 到 `b`， 本文也会使用删节号 `…` 来表示不同的代码或者省略的地方，请注意，这个字符 `…` (而不是这个字符 `...`) 并不是 Go 语言的有效标识之一。

源代码表示方式
--------------------------

源代码是遵照 [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) 编码的 Unicode 文档，The text is not canonicalized, so a single accented code point is distinct from the same character constructed from combining an accent and a letter; those are treated as two code points. For simplicity, this document will use the unqualified term _character_ to refer to a Unicode code point in the source text.

在 Go 语言里，每一个字符都是完全不同的意思，比如说大写字母和小写字母就是两种不同的字符。

限制： 为了跟其他语言的兼容性，Go 的编译器不允许在源代码中出现 NUL 字符 (U+0000)

限制： 为了其他语言的兼容性， 如果源代码的第一个 Unicode 字节是 UTF-8 的标志符 (U+FEFF)， 可能会被编译器忽略，而且同样的字符可能也不会被允许出现在源代码中。

### Characters

The following terms are used to denote specific Unicode character classes:

newline        = /\* the Unicode code point U+000A \*/ .
unicode\_char   = /\* an arbitrary Unicode code point except newline \*/ .
unicode\_letter = /\* a Unicode code point classified as "Letter" \*/ .
unicode\_digit  = /\* a Unicode code point classified as "Number, decimal digit" \*/ .

In [The Unicode Standard 8.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/), Section 4.5 "General Category" defines a set of character categories. Go treats all characters in any of the Letter categories Lu, Ll, Lt, Lm, or Lo as Unicode letters, and those in the Number category Nd as Unicode digits.

### Letters and digits

The underscore character `_` (U+005F) is considered a letter.

letter        = [unicode\_letter](#unicode_letter) | "\_" .
decimal\_digit = "0" … "9" .
binary\_digit  = "0" | "1" .
octal\_digit   = "0" … "7" .
hex\_digit     = "0" … "9" | "A" … "F" | "a" … "f" .

Lexical elements
----------------

### Comments

Comments serve as program documentation. There are two forms:

1.  _Line comments_ start with the character sequence `//` and stop at the end of the line.
2.  _General comments_ start with the character sequence `/*` and stop with the first subsequent character sequence `*/`.

A comment cannot start inside a [rune](#Rune_literals) or [string literal](#String_literals), or inside a comment. A general comment containing no newlines acts like a space. Any other comment acts like a newline.

### Tokens

Tokens form the vocabulary of the Go language. There are four classes: _identifiers_, _keywords_, _operators and punctuation_, and _literals_. _White space_, formed from spaces (U+0020), horizontal tabs (U+0009), carriage returns (U+000D), and newlines (U+000A), is ignored except as it separates tokens that would otherwise combine into a single token. Also, a newline or end of file may trigger the insertion of a [semicolon](#Semicolons). While breaking the input into tokens, the next token is the longest sequence of characters that form a valid token.

### Semicolons

The formal grammar uses semicolons `";"` as terminators in a number of productions. Go programs may omit most of these semicolons using the following two rules:

1.  When the input is broken into tokens, a semicolon is automatically inserted into the token stream immediately after a line's final token if that token is
    *   an [identifier](#Identifiers)
    *   an [integer](#Integer_literals), [floating-point](#Floating-point_literals), [imaginary](#Imaginary_literals), [rune](#Rune_literals), or [string](#String_literals) literal
    *   one of the [keywords](#Keywords) `break`, `continue`, `fallthrough`, or `return`
    *   one of the [operators and punctuation](#Operators_and_punctuation) `++`, `--`, `)`, `]`, or `}`
2.  To allow complex statements to occupy a single line, a semicolon may be omitted before a closing `")"` or `"}"`.

To reflect idiomatic use, code examples in this document elide semicolons using these rules.

### Identifiers

Identifiers name program entities such as variables and types. An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and digits. The first character in an identifier must be a letter.

identifier = [letter](#letter) { [letter](#letter) | [unicode\_digit](#unicode_digit) } .

a
\_x9
ThisVariableIsExported
αβ

Some identifiers are [predeclared](#Predeclared_identifiers).

### Keywords

The following keywords are reserved and may not be used as identifiers.

break        default      func         interface    select
case         defer        go           map          struct
chan         else         goto         package      switch
const        fallthrough  if           range        type
continue     for          import       return       var

### Operators and punctuation

The following character sequences represent [operators](#Operators) (including [assignment operators](#Assignments)) and punctuation:

\+    &     +=    &=     &&    ==    !=    (    )
-    |     -=    |=     ||    <     <=    \[    \]
\*    ^     \*=    ^=     <-    >     >=    {    }
/    <<    /=    <<=    ++    =     :=    ,    ;
%    >>    %=    >>=    --    !     ...   .    :
     &^          &^=          ~

### Integer literals

An integer literal is a sequence of digits representing an [integer constant](#Constants). An optional prefix sets a non-decimal base: `0b` or `0B` for binary, `0`, `0o`, or `0O` for octal, and `0x` or `0X` for hexadecimal. A single `0` is considered a decimal zero. In hexadecimal literals, letters `a` through `f` and `A` through `F` represent values 10 through 15.

For readability, an underscore character `_` may appear after a base prefix or between successive digits; such underscores do not change the literal's value.

int\_lit        = [decimal\_lit](#decimal_lit) | [binary\_lit](#binary_lit) | [octal\_lit](#octal_lit) | [hex\_lit](#hex_lit) .
decimal\_lit    = "0" | ( "1" … "9" ) \[ \[ "\_" \] [decimal\_digits](#decimal_digits) \] .
binary\_lit     = "0" ( "b" | "B" ) \[ "\_" \] [binary\_digits](#binary_digits) .
octal\_lit      = "0" \[ "o" | "O" \] \[ "\_" \] [octal\_digits](#octal_digits) .
hex\_lit        = "0" ( "x" | "X" ) \[ "\_" \] [hex\_digits](#hex_digits) .

decimal\_digits = [decimal\_digit](#decimal_digit) { \[ "\_" \] [decimal\_digit](#decimal_digit) } .
binary\_digits  = [binary\_digit](#binary_digit) { \[ "\_" \] [binary\_digit](#binary_digit) } .
octal\_digits   = [octal\_digit](#octal_digit) { \[ "\_" \] [octal\_digit](#octal_digit) } .
hex\_digits     = [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) { \[ "\_" \] [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) } .

42\_         // invalid: \_ must separate successive digits
4\_\_2        // invalid: only one \_ at a time
0\_xBadFace  // invalid: \_ must separate successive digits

### Floating-point literals

A floating-point literal is a decimal or hexadecimal representation of a [floating-point constant](#Constants).

A decimal floating-point literal consists of an integer part (decimal digits), a decimal point, a fractional part (decimal digits), and an exponent part (`e` or `E` followed by an optional sign and decimal digits). One of the integer part or the fractional part may be elided; one of the decimal point or the exponent part may be elided. An exponent value exp scales the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by 10exp.

A hexadecimal floating-point literal consists of a `0x` or `0X` prefix, an integer part (hexadecimal digits), a radix point, a fractional part (hexadecimal digits), and an exponent part (`p` or `P` followed by an optional sign and decimal digits). One of the integer part or the fractional part may be elided; the radix point may be elided as well, but the exponent part is required. (This syntax matches the one given in IEEE 754-2008 §5.12.3.) An exponent value exp scales the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by 2exp.

For readability, an underscore character `_` may appear after a base prefix or between successive digits; such underscores do not change the literal value.

float\_lit         = [decimal\_float\_lit](#decimal_float_lit) | [hex\_float\_lit](#hex_float_lit) .

decimal\_float\_lit = [decimal\_digits](#decimal_digits) "." \[ [decimal\_digits](#decimal_digits) \] \[ [decimal\_exponent](#decimal_exponent) \] |
                    [decimal\_digits](#decimal_digits) [decimal\_exponent](#decimal_exponent) |
                    "." [decimal\_digits](#decimal_digits) \[ [decimal\_exponent](#decimal_exponent) \] .
decimal\_exponent  = ( "e" | "E" ) \[ "+" | "-" \] [decimal\_digits](#decimal_digits) .

hex\_float\_lit     = "0" ( "x" | "X" ) [hex\_mantissa](#hex_mantissa) [hex\_exponent](#hex_exponent) .
hex\_mantissa      = \[ "\_" \] [hex\_digits](#hex_digits) "." \[ [hex\_digits](#hex_digits) \] |
                    \[ "\_" \] [hex\_digits](#hex_digits) |
                    "." [hex\_digits](#hex_digits) .
hex\_exponent      = ( "p" | "P" ) \[ "+" | "-" \] [decimal\_digits](#decimal_digits) .

1.5e1\_       // invalid: \_ must separate successive digits

### Imaginary literals

An imaginary literal represents the imaginary part of a [complex constant](#Constants). It consists of an [integer](#Integer_literals) or [floating-point](#Floating-point_literals) literal followed by the lower-case letter `i`. The value of an imaginary literal is the value of the respective integer or floating-point literal multiplied by the imaginary unit _i_.

imaginary\_lit = ([decimal\_digits](#decimal_digits) | [int\_lit](#int_lit) | [float\_lit](#float_lit)) "i" .

For backward compatibility, an imaginary literal's integer part consisting entirely of decimal digits (and possibly underscores) is considered a decimal integer, even if it starts with a leading `0`.

0i
0123i         // == 123i for backward-compatibility
0o123i        // == 0o123 \* 1i == 83i

.12345E+5i
0x1p-2i       // == 0x1p-2 \* 1i == 0.25i

### Rune literals

A rune literal represents a [rune constant](#Constants), an integer value identifying a Unicode code point. A rune literal is expressed as one or more characters enclosed in single quotes, as in `'x'` or `'\n'`. Within the quotes, any character may appear except newline and unescaped single quote. A single quoted character represents the Unicode value of the character itself, while multi-character sequences beginning with a backslash encode values in various formats.

The simplest form represents the single character within the quotes; since Go source text is Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8, multiple UTF-8-encoded bytes may represent a single integer value. For instance, the literal `'a'` holds a single byte representing a literal `a`, Unicode U+0061, value `0x61`, while `'ä'` holds two bytes (`0xc3` `0xa4`) representing a literal `a`\-dieresis, U+00E4, value `0xe4`.

Several backslash escapes allow arbitrary values to be encoded as ASCII text. There are four ways to represent the integer value as a numeric constant: `\x` followed by exactly two hexadecimal digits; `\u` followed by exactly four hexadecimal digits; `\U` followed by exactly eight hexadecimal digits, and a plain backslash `\` followed by exactly three octal digits. In each case the value of the literal is the value represented by the digits in the corresponding base.

Although these representations all result in an integer, they have different valid ranges. Octal escapes must represent a value between 0 and 255 inclusive. Hexadecimal escapes satisfy this condition by construction. The escapes `\u` and `\U` represent Unicode code points so within them some values are illegal, in particular those above `0x10FFFF` and surrogate halves.

After a backslash, certain single-character escapes represent special values:

\\a   U+0007 alert or bell
\\b   U+0008 backspace
\\f   U+000C form feed
\\n   U+000A line feed or newline
\\r   U+000D carriage return
\\t   U+0009 horizontal tab
\\v   U+000B vertical tab
\\\\   U+005C backslash
\\'   U+0027 single quote  (valid escape only within rune literals)
\\"   U+0022 double quote  (valid escape only within string literals)

All other sequences starting with a backslash are illegal inside rune literals.

rune\_lit         = "'" ( [unicode\_value](#unicode_value) | [byte\_value](#byte_value) ) "'" .
unicode\_value    = [unicode\_char](#unicode_char) | [little\_u\_value](#little_u_value) | [big\_u\_value](#big_u_value) | [escaped\_char](#escaped_char) .
byte\_value       = [octal\_byte\_value](#octal_byte_value) | [hex\_byte\_value](#hex_byte_value) .
octal\_byte\_value = \`\\\` [octal\_digit](#octal_digit) [octal\_digit](#octal_digit) [octal\_digit](#octal_digit) .
hex\_byte\_value   = \`\\\` "x" [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) .
little\_u\_value   = \`\\\` "u" [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) .
big\_u\_value      = \`\\\` "U" [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit)
                           [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) [hex\_digit](#hex_digit) .
escaped\_char     = \`\\\` ( "a" | "b" | "f" | "n" | "r" | "t" | "v" | \`\\\` | "'" | \`"\` ) .

'a'
'ä'
'本'
'\\t'
'\\000'
'\\007'
'\\377'
'\\x07'
'\\xff'
'\\u12e4'
'\\U00101234'
'\\''         // rune literal containing single quote character
'aa'         // illegal: too many characters
'\\xa'        // illegal: too few hexadecimal digits
'\\0'         // illegal: too few octal digits
'\\uDFFF'     // illegal: surrogate half
'\\U00110000' // illegal: invalid Unicode code point

### String literals

A string literal represents a [string constant](#Constants) obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters. There are two forms: raw string literals and interpreted string literals.

Raw string literals are character sequences between back quotes, as in `` `foo` ``. Within the quotes, any character may appear except back quote. The value of a raw string literal is the string composed of the uninterpreted (implicitly UTF-8-encoded) characters between the quotes; in particular, backslashes have no special meaning and the string may contain newlines. Carriage return characters ('\\r') inside raw string literals are discarded from the raw string value.

Interpreted string literals are character sequences between double quotes, as in `"bar"`. Within the quotes, any character may appear except newline and unescaped double quote. The text between the quotes forms the value of the literal, with backslash escapes interpreted as they are in [rune literals](#Rune_literals) (except that `\'` is illegal and `\"` is legal), with the same restrictions. The three-digit octal (`\`_nnn_) and two-digit hexadecimal (`\x`_nn_) escapes represent individual _bytes_ of the resulting string; all other escapes represent the (possibly multi-byte) UTF-8 encoding of individual _characters_. Thus inside a string literal `\377` and `\xFF` represent a single byte of value `0xFF`\=255, while `ÿ`, `\u00FF`, `\U000000FF` and `\xc3\xbf` represent the two bytes `0xc3` `0xbf` of the UTF-8 encoding of character U+00FF.

string\_lit             = [raw\_string\_lit](#raw_string_lit) | [interpreted\_string\_lit](#interpreted_string_lit) .
raw\_string\_lit         = "\`" { [unicode\_char](#unicode_char) | [newline](#newline) } "\`" .
interpreted\_string\_lit = \`"\` { [unicode\_value](#unicode_value) | [byte\_value](#byte_value) } \`"\` .

\`abc\`                // same as "abc"
\`\\n
\\n\`                  // same as "\\\\n\\n\\\\n"
"\\n"
"\\""                 // same as \`"\`
"Hello, world!\\n"
"日本語"
"\\u65e5本\\U00008a9e"
"\\xff\\u00FF"
"\\uD800"             // illegal: surrogate half
"\\U00110000"         // illegal: invalid Unicode code point

These examples all represent the same string:

"日本語"                                 // UTF-8 input text
\`日本語\`                                 // UTF-8 input text as a raw literal
"\\u65e5\\u672c\\u8a9e"                    // the explicit Unicode code points
"\\U000065e5\\U0000672c\\U00008a9e"        // the explicit Unicode code points
"\\xe6\\x97\\xa5\\xe6\\x9c\\xac\\xe8\\xaa\\x9e"  // the explicit UTF-8 bytes

If the source code represents a character as two code points, such as a combining form involving an accent and a letter, the result will be an error if placed in a rune literal (it is not a single code point), and will appear as two code points if placed in a string literal.

Constants
---------

There are _boolean constants_, _rune constants_, _integer constants_, _floating-point constants_, _complex constants_, and _string constants_. Rune, integer, floating-point, and complex constants are collectively called _numeric constants_.

A constant value is represented by a [rune](#Rune_literals), [integer](#Integer_literals), [floating-point](#Floating-point_literals), [imaginary](#Imaginary_literals), or [string](#String_literals) literal, an identifier denoting a constant, a [constant expression](#Constant_expressions), a [conversion](#Conversions) with a result that is a constant, or the result value of some built-in functions such as `unsafe.Sizeof` applied to [certain values](#Package_unsafe), `cap` or `len` applied to [some expressions](#Length_and_capacity), `real` and `imag` applied to a complex constant and `complex` applied to numeric constants. The boolean truth values are represented by the predeclared constants `true` and `false`. The predeclared identifier [iota](#Iota) denotes an integer constant.

In general, complex constants are a form of [constant expression](#Constant_expressions) and are discussed in that section.

Numeric constants represent exact values of arbitrary precision and do not overflow. Consequently, there are no constants denoting the IEEE-754 negative zero, infinity, and not-a-number values.

Constants may be [typed](#Types) or _untyped_. Literal constants, `true`, `false`, `iota`, and certain [constant expressions](#Constant_expressions) containing only untyped constant operands are untyped.

A constant may be given a type explicitly by a [constant declaration](#Constant_declarations) or [conversion](#Conversions), or implicitly when used in a [variable declaration](#Variable_declarations) or an [assignment](#Assignments) or as an operand in an [expression](#Expressions). It is an error if the constant value cannot be [represented](#Representability) as a value of the respective type. If the type is a type parameter, the constant is converted into a non-constant value of the type parameter.

An untyped constant has a _default type_ which is the type to which the constant is implicitly converted in contexts where a typed value is required, for instance, in a [short variable declaration](#Short_variable_declarations) such as `i := 0` where there is no explicit type. The default type of an untyped constant is `bool`, `rune`, `int`, `float64`, `complex128` or `string` respectively, depending on whether it is a boolean, rune, integer, floating-point, complex, or string constant.

Implementation restriction: Although numeric constants have arbitrary precision in the language, a compiler may implement them using an internal representation with limited precision. That said, every implementation must:

*   Represent integer constants with at least 256 bits.
*   Represent floating-point constants, including the parts of a complex constant, with a mantissa of at least 256 bits and a signed binary exponent of at least 16 bits.
*   Give an error if unable to represent an integer constant precisely.
*   Give an error if unable to represent a floating-point or complex constant due to overflow.
*   Round to the nearest representable constant if unable to represent a floating-point or complex constant due to limits on precision.

These requirements apply both to literal constants and to the result of evaluating [constant expressions](#Constant_expressions).

Variables
---------

A variable is a storage location for holding a _value_. The set of permissible values is determined by the variable's _[type](#Types)_.

A [variable declaration](#Variable_declarations) or, for function parameters and results, the signature of a [function declaration](#Function_declarations) or [function literal](#Function_literals) reserves storage for a named variable. Calling the built-in function [`new`](#Allocation) or taking the address of a [composite literal](#Composite_literals) allocates storage for a variable at run time. Such an anonymous variable is referred to via a (possibly implicit) [pointer indirection](#Address_operators).

_Structured_ variables of [array](#Array_types), [slice](#Slice_types), and [struct](#Struct_types) types have elements and fields that may be [addressed](#Address_operators) individually. Each such element acts like a variable.

The _static type_ (or just _type_) of a variable is the type given in its declaration, the type provided in the `new` call or composite literal, or the type of an element of a structured variable. Variables of interface type also have a distinct _dynamic type_, which is the (non-interface) type of the value assigned to the variable at run time (unless the value is the predeclared identifier `nil`, which has no type). The dynamic type may vary during execution but values stored in interface variables are always [assignable](#Assignability) to the static type of the variable.

var x interface{}  // x is nil and has static type interface{}
var v \*T           // v has value nil, static type \*T
x = 42             // x has value 42 and dynamic type int
x = v              // x has value (\*T)(nil) and dynamic type \*T

A variable's value is retrieved by referring to the variable in an [expression](#Expressions); it is the most recent value [assigned](#Assignments) to the variable. If a variable has not yet been assigned a value, its value is the [zero value](#The_zero_value) for its type.

Types
-----

A type determines a set of values together with operations and methods specific to those values. A type may be denoted by a _type name_, if it has one, which must be followed by [type arguments](#Instantiations) if the type is generic. A type may also be specified using a _type literal_, which composes a type from existing types.

Type      = [TypeName](#TypeName) \[ [TypeArgs](#TypeArgs) \] | [TypeLit](#TypeLit) | "(" [Type](#Type) ")" .
TypeName  = [identifier](#identifier) | [QualifiedIdent](#QualifiedIdent) .
TypeArgs  = "\[" [TypeList](#TypeList) \[ "," \] "\]" .
TypeList  = [Type](#Type) { "," [Type](#Type) } .
TypeLit   = [ArrayType](#ArrayType) | [StructType](#StructType) | [PointerType](#PointerType) | [FunctionType](#FunctionType) | [InterfaceType](#InterfaceType) |
	    [SliceType](#SliceType) | [MapType](#MapType) | [ChannelType](#ChannelType) .

The language [predeclares](#Predeclared_identifiers) certain type names. Others are introduced with [type declarations](#Type_declarations) or [type parameter lists](#Type_parameter_declarations). _Composite types_—array, struct, pointer, function, interface, slice, map, and channel types—may be constructed using type literals.

Predeclared types, defined types, and type parameters are called _named types_. An alias denotes a named type if the type given in the alias declaration is a named type.

### Boolean types

A _boolean type_ represents the set of Boolean truth values denoted by the predeclared constants `true` and `false`. The predeclared boolean type is `bool`; it is a [defined type](#Type_definitions).

### Numeric types

An _integer_, _floating-point_, or _complex_ type represents the set of integer, floating-point, or complex values, respectively. They are collectively called _numeric types_. The predeclared architecture-independent numeric types are:

uint8       the set of all unsigned  8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16      the set of all unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32      the set of all unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64      the set of all unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)

int8        the set of all signed  8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16       the set of all signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32       the set of all signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64       the set of all signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

float32     the set of all IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64     the set of all IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers

complex64   the set of all complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
complex128  the set of all complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts

byte        alias for uint8
rune        alias for int32

The value of an _n_\-bit integer is _n_ bits wide and represented using [two's complement arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement).

There is also a set of predeclared integer types with implementation-specific sizes:

uint     either 32 or 64 bits
int      same size as uint
uintptr  an unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value

To avoid portability issues all numeric types are [defined types](#Type_definitions) and thus distinct except `byte`, which is an [alias](#Alias_declarations) for `uint8`, and `rune`, which is an alias for `int32`. Explicit conversions are required when different numeric types are mixed in an expression or assignment. For instance, `int32` and `int` are not the same type even though they may have the same size on a particular architecture.

### String types

A _string type_ represents the set of string values. A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes. The number of bytes is called the length of the string and is never negative. Strings are immutable: once created, it is impossible to change the contents of a string. The predeclared string type is `string`; it is a [defined type](#Type_definitions).

The length of a string `s` can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](#Length_and_capacity). The length is a compile-time constant if the string is a constant. A string's bytes can be accessed by integer [indices](#Index_expressions) 0 through `len(s)-1`. It is illegal to take the address of such an element; if `s[i]` is the `i`'th byte of a string, `&s[i]` is invalid.

### Array types

An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type, called the element type. The number of elements is called the length of the array and is never negative.

ArrayType   = "\[" [ArrayLength](#ArrayLength) "\]" [ElementType](#ElementType) .
ArrayLength = [Expression](#Expression) .
ElementType = [Type](#Type) .

The length is part of the array's type; it must evaluate to a non-negative [constant](#Constants) [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `int`. The length of array `a` can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](#Length_and_capacity). The elements can be addressed by integer [indices](#Index_expressions) 0 through `len(a)-1`. Array types are always one-dimensional but may be composed to form multi-dimensional types.

\[32\]byte
\[2\*N\] struct { x, y int32 }
\[1000\]\*float64
\[3\]\[5\]int
\[2\]\[2\]\[2\]float64  // same as \[2\](\[2\](\[2\]float64))

### Slice types

A slice is a descriptor for a contiguous segment of an _underlying array_ and provides access to a numbered sequence of elements from that array. A slice type denotes the set of all slices of arrays of its element type. The number of elements is called the length of the slice and is never negative. The value of an uninitialized slice is `nil`.

SliceType = "\[" "\]" [ElementType](#ElementType) .

The length of a slice `s` can be discovered by the built-in function [`len`](#Length_and_capacity); unlike with arrays it may change during execution. The elements can be addressed by integer [indices](#Index_expressions) 0 through `len(s)-1`. The slice index of a given element may be less than the index of the same element in the underlying array.

A slice, once initialized, is always associated with an underlying array that holds its elements. A slice therefore shares storage with its array and with other slices of the same array; by contrast, distinct arrays always represent distinct storage.

The array underlying a slice may extend past the end of the slice. The _capacity_ is a measure of that extent: it is the sum of the length of the slice and the length of the array beyond the slice; a slice of length up to that capacity can be created by [_slicing_](#Slice_expressions) a new one from the original slice. The capacity of a slice `a` can be discovered using the built-in function [`cap(a)`](#Length_and_capacity).

A new, initialized slice value for a given element type `T` may be made using the built-in function [`make`](#Making_slices_maps_and_channels), which takes a slice type and parameters specifying the length and optionally the capacity. A slice created with `make` always allocates a new, hidden array to which the returned slice value refers. That is, executing

make(\[\]T, length, capacity)

produces the same slice as allocating an array and [slicing](#Slice_expressions) it, so these two expressions are equivalent:

make(\[\]int, 50, 100)
new(\[100\]int)\[0:50\]

Like arrays, slices are always one-dimensional but may be composed to construct higher-dimensional objects. With arrays of arrays, the inner arrays are, by construction, always the same length; however with slices of slices (or arrays of slices), the inner lengths may vary dynamically. Moreover, the inner slices must be initialized individually.

### Struct types

A struct is a sequence of named elements, called fields, each of which has a name and a type. Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). Within a struct, non-[blank](#Blank_identifier) field names must be [unique](#Uniqueness_of_identifiers).

StructType    = "struct" "{" { [FieldDecl](#FieldDecl) ";" } "}" .
FieldDecl     = ([IdentifierList](#IdentifierList) [Type](#Type) | [EmbeddedField](#EmbeddedField)) \[ [Tag](#Tag) \] .
EmbeddedField = \[ "\*" \] [TypeName](#TypeName) .
Tag           = [string\_lit](#string_lit) .

// An empty struct.
struct {}

// A struct with 6 fields.
struct {
	x, y int
	u float32
	\_ float32  // padding
	A \*\[\]int
	F func()
}

A field declared with a type but no explicit field name is called an _embedded field_. An embedded field must be specified as a type name `T` or as a pointer to a non-interface type name `*T`, and `T` itself may not be a pointer type. The unqualified type name acts as the field name.

// A struct with four embedded fields of types T1, \*T2, P.T3 and \*P.T4
struct {
	T1        // field name is T1
	\*T2       // field name is T2
	P.T3      // field name is T3
	\*P.T4     // field name is T4
	x, y int  // field names are x and y
}

The following declaration is illegal because field names must be unique in a struct type:

struct {
	T     // conflicts with embedded field \*T and \*P.T
	\*T    // conflicts with embedded field T and \*P.T
	\*P.T  // conflicts with embedded field T and \*T
}

A field or [method](#Method_declarations) `f` of an embedded field in a struct `x` is called _promoted_ if `x.f` is a legal [selector](#Selectors) that denotes that field or method `f`.

Promoted fields act like ordinary fields of a struct except that they cannot be used as field names in [composite literals](#Composite_literals) of the struct.

Given a struct type `S` and a [defined type](#Type_definitions) `T`, promoted methods are included in the method set of the struct as follows:

*   If `S` contains an embedded field `T`, the [method sets](#Method_sets) of `S` and `*S` both include promoted methods with receiver `T`. The method set of `*S` also includes promoted methods with receiver `*T`.
*   If `S` contains an embedded field `*T`, the method sets of `S` and `*S` both include promoted methods with receiver `T` or `*T`.

A field declaration may be followed by an optional string literal _tag_, which becomes an attribute for all the fields in the corresponding field declaration. An empty tag string is equivalent to an absent tag. The tags are made visible through a [reflection interface](/pkg/reflect/#StructTag) and take part in [type identity](#Type_identity) for structs but are otherwise ignored.

struct {
	x, y float64 ""  // an empty tag string is like an absent tag
	name string  "any string is permitted as a tag"
	\_    \[4\]byte "ceci n'est pas un champ de structure"
}

// A struct corresponding to a TimeStamp protocol buffer.
// The tag strings define the protocol buffer field numbers;
// they follow the convention outlined by the reflect package.
struct {
	microsec  uint64 \`protobuf:"1"\`
	serverIP6 uint64 \`protobuf:"2"\`
}

### Pointer types

A pointer type denotes the set of all pointers to [variables](#Variables) of a given type, called the _base type_ of the pointer. The value of an uninitialized pointer is `nil`.

PointerType = "\*" [BaseType](#BaseType) .
BaseType    = [Type](#Type) .

\*Point
\*\[4\]int

### Function types

A function type denotes the set of all functions with the same parameter and result types. The value of an uninitialized variable of function type is `nil`.

FunctionType   = "func" [Signature](#Signature) .
Signature      = [Parameters](#Parameters) \[ [Result](#Result) \] .
Result         = [Parameters](#Parameters) | [Type](#Type) .
Parameters     = "(" \[ [ParameterList](#ParameterList) \[ "," \] \] ")" .
ParameterList  = [ParameterDecl](#ParameterDecl) { "," [ParameterDecl](#ParameterDecl) } .
ParameterDecl  = \[ [IdentifierList](#IdentifierList) \] \[ "..." \] [Type](#Type) .

Within a list of parameters or results, the names (IdentifierList) must either all be present or all be absent. If present, each name stands for one item (parameter or result) of the specified type and all non-[blank](#Blank_identifier) names in the signature must be [unique](#Uniqueness_of_identifiers). If absent, each type stands for one item of that type. Parameter and result lists are always parenthesized except that if there is exactly one unnamed result it may be written as an unparenthesized type.

The final incoming parameter in a function signature may have a type prefixed with `...`. A function with such a parameter is called _variadic_ and may be invoked with zero or more arguments for that parameter.

func()
func(x int) int
func(a, \_ int, z float32) bool
func(a, b int, z float32) (bool)
func(prefix string, values ...int)
func(a, b int, z float64, opt ...interface{}) (success bool)
func(int, int, float64) (float64, \*\[\]int)
func(n int) func(p \*T)

### Interface types

An interface type defines a _type set_. A variable of interface type can store a value of any type that is in the type set of the interface. Such a type is said to [implement the interface](#Implementing_an_interface). The value of an uninitialized variable of interface type is `nil`.

InterfaceType  = "interface" "{" { [InterfaceElem](#InterfaceElem) ";" } "}" .
InterfaceElem  = [MethodElem](#MethodElem) | [TypeElem](#TypeElem) .
MethodElem     = [MethodName](#MethodName) [Signature](#Signature) .
MethodName     = [identifier](#identifier) .
TypeElem       = [TypeTerm](#TypeTerm) { "|" [TypeTerm](#TypeTerm) } .
TypeTerm       = [Type](#Type) | [UnderlyingType](#UnderlyingType) .
UnderlyingType = "~" [Type](#Type) .

An interface type is specified by a list of _interface elements_. An interface element is either a _method_ or a _type element_, where a type element is a union of one or more _type terms_. A type term is either a single type or a single underlying type.

#### Basic interfaces

In its most basic form an interface specifies a (possibly empty) list of methods. The type set defined by such an interface is the set of types which implement all of those methods, and the corresponding [method set](#Method_sets) consists exactly of the methods specified by the interface. Interfaces whose type sets can be defined entirely by a list of methods are called _basic interfaces._

// A simple File interface.
interface {
	Read(\[\]byte) (int, error)
	Write(\[\]byte) (int, error)
	Close() error
}

The name of each explicitly specified method must be [unique](#Uniqueness_of_identifiers) and not [blank](#Blank_identifier).

interface {
	String() string
	String() string  // illegal: String not unique
	\_(x int)         // illegal: method must have non-blank name
}

More than one type may implement an interface. For instance, if two types `S1` and `S2` have the method set

func (p T) Read(p \[\]byte) (n int, err error)
func (p T) Write(p \[\]byte) (n int, err error)
func (p T) Close() error

(where `T` stands for either `S1` or `S2`) then the `File` interface is implemented by both `S1` and `S2`, regardless of what other methods `S1` and `S2` may have or share.

Every type that is a member of the type set of an interface implements that interface. Any given type may implement several distinct interfaces. For instance, all types implement the _empty interface_ which stands for the set of all types:

interface{}

For convenience, the predeclared type `any` is an alias for the empty interface.

Similarly, consider this interface specification, which appears within a [type declaration](#Type_declarations) to define an interface called `Locker`:

type Locker interface {
	Lock()
	Unlock()
}

If `S1` and `S2` also implement

func (p T) Lock() { … }
func (p T) Unlock() { … }

they implement the `Locker` interface as well as the `File` interface.

#### Embedded interfaces

In a slightly more general form an interface `T` may use a (possibly qualified) interface type name `E` as an interface element. This is called _embedding_ interface `E` in `T`. The type set of `T` is the _intersection_ of the type sets defined by `T`'s explicitly declared methods and the type sets of `T`’s embedded interfaces. In other words, the type set of `T` is the set of all types that implement all the explicitly declared methods of `T` and also all the methods of `E`.

type Reader interface {
	Read(p \[\]byte) (n int, err error)
	Close() error
}

type Writer interface {
	Write(p \[\]byte) (n int, err error)
	Close() error
}

// ReadWriter's methods are Read, Write, and Close.
type ReadWriter interface {
	Reader  // includes methods of Reader in ReadWriter's method set
	Writer  // includes methods of Writer in ReadWriter's method set
}

When embedding interfaces, methods with the [same](#Uniqueness_of_identifiers) names must have [identical](#Type_identity) signatures.

type ReadCloser interface {
	Reader   // includes methods of Reader in ReadCloser's method set
	Close()  // illegal: signatures of Reader.Close and Close are different
}

#### General interfaces

In their most general form, an interface element may also be an arbitrary type term `T`, or a term of the form `~T` specifying the underlying type `T`, or a union of terms `t1|t2|…|tn`. Together with method specifications, these elements enable the precise definition of an interface's type set as follows:

*   The type set of the empty interface is the set of all non-interface types.
*   The type set of a non-empty interface is the intersection of the type sets of its interface elements.
*   The type set of a method specification is the set of types whose method sets include that method.
*   The type set of a non-interface type term is the set consisting of just that type.
*   The type set of a term of the form `~T` is the set of types whose underlying type is `T`.
*   The type set of a _union_ of terms `t1|t2|…|tn` is the union of the type sets of the terms.

By construction, an interface's type set never contains an interface type.

// An interface representing only the type int.
interface {
	int
}

// An interface representing all types with underlying type int.
interface {
	~int
}

// An interface representing all types with underlying type int that implement the String method.
interface {
	~int
	String() string
}

// An interface representing an empty type set: there is no type that is both an int and a string.
interface {
	int
	string
}

In a term of the form `~T`, the underlying type of `T` must be itself, and `T` cannot be an interface.

type MyInt int

interface {
	~\[\]byte  // the underlying type of \[\]byte is itself
	~MyInt   // illegal: the underlying type of MyInt is not MyInt
	~error   // illegal: error is an interface
}

Union elements denote unions of type sets:

// The Float interface represents all floating-point types
// (including any named types whose underlying types are
// either float32 or float64).
type Float interface {
	~float32 | ~float64
}

In a union, a term cannot be a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), and the type sets of all non-interface terms must be pairwise disjoint (the pairwise intersection of the type sets must be empty). Given a type parameter `P`:

interface {
	P                // illegal: P is a type parameter
	int | P          // illegal: P is a type parameter
	~int | MyInt     // illegal: the type sets for ~int and MyInt are not disjoint (~int includes MyInt)
	float32 | Float  // overlapping type sets but Float is an interface
}

Implementation restriction: A union (with more than one term) cannot contain the [predeclared identifier](#Predeclared_identifiers) `comparable` or interfaces that specify methods, or embed `comparable` or interfaces that specify methods.

Interfaces that are not [basic](#Basic_interfaces) may only be used as type constraints, or as elements of other interfaces used as constraints. They cannot be the types of values or variables, or components of other, non-interface types.

var x Float                     // illegal: Float is not a basic interface

var x interface{} = Float(nil)  // illegal

type Floatish struct {
	f Float                 // illegal
}

An interface type `T` may not embed any type element that is, contains, or embeds `T`, recursively.

// illegal: Bad cannot embed itself
type Bad interface {
	Bad
}

// illegal: Bad1 cannot embed itself using Bad2
type Bad1 interface {
	Bad2
}
type Bad2 interface {
	Bad1
}

// illegal: Bad3 cannot embed a union containing Bad3
type Bad3 interface {
	~int | ~string | Bad3
}

#### Implementing an interface

A type `T` implements an interface `I` if

*   `T` is not an interface and is an element of the type set of `I`; or
*   `T` is an interface and the type set of `T` is a subset of the type set of `I`.

A value of type `T` implements an interface if `T` implements the interface.

### Map types

A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, called the element type, indexed by a set of unique _keys_ of another type, called the key type. The value of an uninitialized map is `nil`.

MapType     = "map" "\[" [KeyType](#KeyType) "\]" [ElementType](#ElementType) .
KeyType     = [Type](#Type) .

The [comparison operators](#Comparison_operators) `==` and `!=` must be fully defined for operands of the key type; thus the key type must not be a function, map, or slice. If the key type is an interface type, these comparison operators must be defined for the dynamic key values; failure will cause a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics).

map\[string\]int
map\[\*T\]struct{ x, y float64 }
map\[string\]interface{}

The number of map elements is called its length. For a map `m`, it can be discovered using the built-in function [`len`](#Length_and_capacity) and may change during execution. Elements may be added during execution using [assignments](#Assignments) and retrieved with [index expressions](#Index_expressions); they may be removed with the [`delete`](#Deletion_of_map_elements) built-in function.

A new, empty map value is made using the built-in function [`make`](#Making_slices_maps_and_channels), which takes the map type and an optional capacity hint as arguments:

make(map\[string\]int)
make(map\[string\]int, 100)

The initial capacity does not bound its size: maps grow to accommodate the number of items stored in them, with the exception of `nil` maps. A `nil` map is equivalent to an empty map except that no elements may be added.

### Channel types

A channel provides a mechanism for [concurrently executing functions](#Go_statements) to communicate by [sending](#Send_statements) and [receiving](#Receive_operator) values of a specified element type. The value of an uninitialized channel is `nil`.

ChannelType = ( "chan" | "chan" "<-" | "<-" "chan" ) [ElementType](#ElementType) .

The optional `<-` operator specifies the channel _direction_, _send_ or _receive_. If a direction is given, the channel is _directional_, otherwise it is _bidirectional_. A channel may be constrained only to send or only to receive by [assignment](#Assignments) or explicit [conversion](#Conversions).

chan T          // can be used to send and receive values of type T
chan<- float64  // can only be used to send float64s
<-chan int      // can only be used to receive ints

The `<-` operator associates with the leftmost `chan` possible:

chan<- chan int    // same as chan<- (chan int)
chan<- <-chan int  // same as chan<- (<-chan int)
<-chan <-chan int  // same as <-chan (<-chan int)
chan (<-chan int)

A new, initialized channel value can be made using the built-in function [`make`](#Making_slices_maps_and_channels), which takes the channel type and an optional _capacity_ as arguments:

make(chan int, 100)

The capacity, in number of elements, sets the size of the buffer in the channel. If the capacity is zero or absent, the channel is unbuffered and communication succeeds only when both a sender and receiver are ready. Otherwise, the channel is buffered and communication succeeds without blocking if the buffer is not full (sends) or not empty (receives). A `nil` channel is never ready for communication.

A channel may be closed with the built-in function [`close`](#Close). The multi-valued assignment form of the [receive operator](#Receive_operator) reports whether a received value was sent before the channel was closed.

A single channel may be used in [send statements](#Send_statements), [receive operations](#Receive_operator), and calls to the built-in functions [`cap`](#Length_and_capacity) and [`len`](#Length_and_capacity) by any number of goroutines without further synchronization. Channels act as first-in-first-out queues. For example, if one goroutine sends values on a channel and a second goroutine receives them, the values are received in the order sent.

Properties of types and values
------------------------------

### Underlying types

Each type `T` has an _underlying type_: If `T` is one of the predeclared boolean, numeric, or string types, or a type literal, the corresponding underlying type is `T` itself. Otherwise, `T`'s underlying type is the underlying type of the type to which `T` refers in its declaration. For a type parameter that is the underlying type of its [type constraint](#Type_constraints), which is always an interface.

type (
	A1 = string
	A2 = A1
)

type (
	B1 string
	B2 B1
	B3 \[\]B1
	B4 B3
)

func f\[P any\](x P) { … }

The underlying type of `string`, `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, and `B2` is `string`. The underlying type of `[]B1`, `B3`, and `B4` is `[]B1`. The underlying type of `P` is `interface{}`.

### Core types

Each non-interface type `T` has a _core type_, which is the same as the [underlying type](#Underlying_types) of `T`.

An interface `T` has a core type if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

1.  There is a single type `U` which is the [underlying type](#Underlying_types) of all types in the [type set](#Interface_types) of `T`; or
2.  the type set of `T` contains only [channel types](#Channel_types) with identical element type `E`, and all directional channels have the same direction.

No other interfaces have a core type.

The core type of an interface is, depending on the condition that is satisfied, either:

1.  the type `U`; or
2.  the type `chan E` if `T` contains only bidirectional channels, or the type `chan<- E` or `<-chan E` depending on the direction of the directional channels present.

By definition, a core type is never a [defined type](#Type_definitions), [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), or [interface type](#Interface_types).

Examples of interfaces with core types:

type Celsius float32
type Kelvin  float32

interface{ int }                          // int
interface{ Celsius|Kelvin }               // float32
interface{ ~chan int }                    // chan int
interface{ ~chan int|~chan<- int }        // chan<- int
interface{ ~\[\]\*data; String() string }    // \[\]\*data

Examples of interfaces without core types:

interface{}                               // no single underlying type
interface{ Celsius|float64 }              // no single underlying type
interface{ chan int | chan<- string }     // channels have different element types
interface{ <-chan int | chan<- int }      // directional channels have different directions

### Type identity

Two types are either _identical_ or _different_.

A [named type](#Types) is always different from any other type. Otherwise, two types are identical if their [underlying](#Types) type literals are structurally equivalent; that is, they have the same literal structure and corresponding components have identical types. In detail:

*   Two array types are identical if they have identical element types and the same array length.
*   Two slice types are identical if they have identical element types.
*   Two struct types are identical if they have the same sequence of fields, and if corresponding fields have the same names, and identical types, and identical tags. [Non-exported](#Exported_identifiers) field names from different packages are always different.
*   Two pointer types are identical if they have identical base types.
*   Two function types are identical if they have the same number of parameters and result values, corresponding parameter and result types are identical, and either both functions are variadic or neither is. Parameter and result names are not required to match.
*   Two interface types are identical if they define the same type set.
*   Two map types are identical if they have identical key and element types.
*   Two channel types are identical if they have identical element types and the same direction.
*   Two [instantiated](#Instantiations) types are identical if their defined types and all type arguments are identical.

	C0 = B0
	D0\[P1, P2 any\] struct{ x P1; y P2 }
	E0 = D0\[int, string\]
)

these types are identical:

A0, A1, and \[\]string
A2 and struct{ a, b int }
A3 and int
A4, func(int, float64) \*\[\]string, and A5

B0 and C0
D0\[int, string\] and E0
\[\]int and \[\]int
struct{ a, b \*T5 } and struct{ a, b \*T5 }
func(x int, y float64) \*\[\]string, func(int, float64) (result \*\[\]string), and A5

`B0` and `B1` are different because they are new types created by distinct [type definitions](#Type_definitions); `func(int, float64) *B0` and `func(x int, y float64) *[]string` are different because `B0` is different from `[]string`; and `P1` and `P2` are different because they are different type parameters. `D0[int, string]` and `struct{ x int; y string }` are different because the former is an [instantiated](#Instantiations) defined type while the latter is a type literal (but they are still [assignable](#Assignability)).

### Assignability

A value `x` of type `V` is _assignable_ to a [variable](#Variables) of type `T` ("`x` is assignable to `T`") if one of the following conditions applies:

*   `V` and `T` are identical.
*   `V` and `T` have identical [underlying types](#Underlying_types) and at least one of `V` or `T` is not a [named type](#Types).
*   `V` and `T` are channel types with identical element types, `V` is a bidirectional channel, and at least one of `V` or `T` is not a [named type](#Types).
*   `T` is an interface type, but not a type parameter, and `x` [implements](#Implementing_an_interface) `T`.
*   `x` is the predeclared identifier `nil` and `T` is a pointer, function, slice, map, channel, or interface type, but not a type parameter.
*   `x` is an untyped [constant](#Constants) [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `T`.

Additionally, if `x`'s type `V` or `T` are type parameters, `x` is assignable to a variable of type `T` if one of the following conditions applies:

*   `x` is the predeclared identifier `nil`, `T` is a type parameter, and `x` is assignable to each type in `T`'s type set.
*   `V` is not a [named type](#Types), `T` is a type parameter, and `x` is assignable to each type in `T`'s type set.
*   `V` is a type parameter and `T` is not a named type, and values of each type in `V`'s type set are assignable to `T`.

### Representability

A [constant](#Constants) `x` is _representable_ by a value of type `T`, where `T` is not a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), if one of the following conditions applies:

*   `x` is in the set of values [determined](#Types) by `T`.
*   `T` is a [floating-point type](#Numeric_types) and `x` can be rounded to `T`'s precision without overflow. Rounding uses IEEE 754 round-to-even rules but with an IEEE negative zero further simplified to an unsigned zero. Note that constant values never result in an IEEE negative zero, NaN, or infinity.
*   `T` is a complex type, and `x`'s [components](#Complex_numbers) `real(x)` and `imag(x)` are representable by values of `T`'s component type (`float32` or `float64`).

If `T` is a type parameter, `x` is representable by a value of type `T` if `x` is representable by a value of each type in `T`'s type set.

x                   T           x is representable by a value of T because

'a'                 byte        97 is in the set of byte values

-1                  uint16      -1 is not in the set of unsigned 16-bit integers
1.1                 int         1.1 is not an integer value
42i                 float32     (0 + 42i) is not in the set of float32 values
1e1000              float64     1e1000 overflows to IEEE +Inf after rounding

### Method sets

The _method set_ of a type determines the methods that can be [called](#Calls) on an [operand](#Operands) of that type. Every type has a (possibly empty) method set associated with it:

*   The method set of a [defined type](#Type_definitions) `T` consists of all [methods](#Method_declarations) declared with receiver type `T`.
*   The method set of a pointer to a defined type `T` (where `T` is neither a pointer nor an interface) is the set of all methods declared with receiver `*T` or `T`.
*   The method set of an [interface type](#Interface_types) is the intersection of the method sets of each type in the interface's [type set](#Interface_types) (the resulting method set is usually just the set of declared methods in the interface).

Further rules apply to structs (and pointer to structs) containing embedded fields, as described in the section on [struct types](#Struct_types). Any other type has an empty method set.

In a method set, each method must have a [unique](#Uniqueness_of_identifiers) non-[blank](#Blank_identifier) [method name](#MethodName).

Blocks
------

A _block_ is a possibly empty sequence of declarations and statements within matching brace brackets.

Block = "{" [StatementList](#StatementList) "}" .
StatementList = { [Statement](#Statement) ";" } .

In addition to explicit blocks in the source code, there are implicit blocks:

1.  The _universe block_ encompasses all Go source text.
2.  Each [package](#Packages) has a _package block_ containing all Go source text for that package.
3.  Each file has a _file block_ containing all Go source text in that file.
4.  Each ["if"](#If_statements), ["for"](#For_statements), and ["switch"](#Switch_statements) statement is considered to be in its own implicit block.
5.  Each clause in a ["switch"](#Switch_statements) or ["select"](#Select_statements) statement acts as an implicit block.

Blocks nest and influence [scoping](#Declarations_and_scope).

Declarations and scope
----------------------

A _declaration_ binds a non-[blank](#Blank_identifier) identifier to a [constant](#Constant_declarations), [type](#Type_declarations), [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), [variable](#Variable_declarations), [function](#Function_declarations), [label](#Labeled_statements), or [package](#Import_declarations). Every identifier in a program must be declared. No identifier may be declared twice in the same block, and no identifier may be declared in both the file and package block.

The [blank identifier](#Blank_identifier) may be used like any other identifier in a declaration, but it does not introduce a binding and thus is not declared. In the package block, the identifier `init` may only be used for [`init` function](#Package_initialization) declarations, and like the blank identifier it does not introduce a new binding.

Declaration   = [ConstDecl](#ConstDecl) | [TypeDecl](#TypeDecl) | [VarDecl](#VarDecl) .
TopLevelDecl  = [Declaration](#Declaration) | [FunctionDecl](#FunctionDecl) | [MethodDecl](#MethodDecl) .

The _scope_ of a declared identifier is the extent of source text in which the identifier denotes the specified constant, type, variable, function, label, or package.

Go is lexically scoped using [blocks](#Blocks):

1.  The scope of a [predeclared identifier](#Predeclared_identifiers) is the universe block.
2.  The scope of an identifier denoting a constant, type, variable, or function (but not method) declared at top level (outside any function) is the package block.
3.  The scope of the package name of an imported package is the file block of the file containing the import declaration.
4.  The scope of an identifier denoting a method receiver, function parameter, or result variable is the function body.
5.  The scope of an identifier denoting a type parameter of a function or declared by a method receiver is the function body and all parameter lists of the function.
6.  The scope of an identifier denoting a type parameter of a type begins after the name of the type and ends at the end of the TypeSpec.
7.  The scope of a constant or variable identifier declared inside a function begins at the end of the ConstSpec or VarSpec (ShortVarDecl for short variable declarations) and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.
8.  The scope of a type identifier declared inside a function begins at the identifier in the TypeSpec and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.

An identifier declared in a block may be redeclared in an inner block. While the identifier of the inner declaration is in scope, it denotes the entity declared by the inner declaration.

The [package clause](#Package_clause) is not a declaration; the package name does not appear in any scope. Its purpose is to identify the files belonging to the same [package](#Packages) and to specify the default package name for import declarations.

### Label scopes

Labels are declared by [labeled statements](#Labeled_statements) and are used in the ["break"](#Break_statements), ["continue"](#Continue_statements), and ["goto"](#Goto_statements) statements. It is illegal to define a label that is never used. In contrast to other identifiers, labels are not block scoped and do not conflict with identifiers that are not labels. The scope of a label is the body of the function in which it is declared and excludes the body of any nested function.

### Blank identifier

The _blank identifier_ is represented by the underscore character `_`. It serves as an anonymous placeholder instead of a regular (non-blank) identifier and has special meaning in [declarations](#Declarations_and_scope), as an [operand](#Operands), and in [assignments](#Assignments).

### Predeclared identifiers

The following identifiers are implicitly declared in the [universe block](#Blocks):

Types:
	any bool byte comparable
	complex64 complex128 error float32 float64
	int int8 int16 int32 int64 rune string
	uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

Constants:
	true false iota

Zero value:
	nil

Functions:
	append cap close complex copy delete imag len
	make new panic print println real recover

### Exported identifiers

An identifier may be _exported_ to permit access to it from another package. An identifier is exported if both:

1.  the first character of the identifier's name is a Unicode upper case letter (Unicode class "Lu"); and
2.  the identifier is declared in the [package block](#Blocks) or it is a [field name](#Struct_types) or [method name](#MethodName).

All other identifiers are not exported.

### Uniqueness of identifiers

Given a set of identifiers, an identifier is called _unique_ if it is _different_ from every other in the set. Two identifiers are different if they are spelled differently, or if they appear in different [packages](#Packages) and are not [exported](#Exported_identifiers). Otherwise, they are the same.

### Constant declarations

A constant declaration binds a list of identifiers (the names of the constants) to the values of a list of [constant expressions](#Constant_expressions). The number of identifiers must be equal to the number of expressions, and the _n_th identifier on the left is bound to the value of the _n_th expression on the right.

ConstDecl      = "const" ( [ConstSpec](#ConstSpec) | "(" { [ConstSpec](#ConstSpec) ";" } ")" ) .
ConstSpec      = [IdentifierList](#IdentifierList) \[ \[ [Type](#Type) \] "=" [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) \] .

IdentifierList = [identifier](#identifier) { "," [identifier](#identifier) } .
ExpressionList = [Expression](#Expression) { "," [Expression](#Expression) } .

If the type is present, all constants take the type specified, and the expressions must be [assignable](#Assignability) to that type, which must not be a type parameter. If the type is omitted, the constants take the individual types of the corresponding expressions. If the expression values are untyped [constants](#Constants), the declared constants remain untyped and the constant identifiers denote the constant values. For instance, if the expression is a floating-point literal, the constant identifier denotes a floating-point constant, even if the literal's fractional part is zero.

const Pi float64 = 3.14159265358979323846
const zero = 0.0         // untyped floating-point constant
const (
	size int64 = 1024
	eof        = -1  // untyped integer constant
)
const a, b, c = 3, 4, "foo"  // a = 3, b = 4, c = "foo", untyped integer and string constants
const u, v float32 = 0, 3    // u = 0.0, v = 3.0

Within a parenthesized `const` declaration list the expression list may be omitted from any but the first ConstSpec. Such an empty list is equivalent to the textual substitution of the first preceding non-empty expression list and its type if any. Omitting the list of expressions is therefore equivalent to repeating the previous list. The number of identifiers must be equal to the number of expressions in the previous list. Together with the [`iota` constant generator](#Iota) this mechanism permits light-weight declaration of sequential values:

const (
	Sunday = iota
	Monday
	Tuesday
	Wednesday
	Thursday
	Friday
	Partyday
	numberOfDays  // this constant is not exported
)

### Iota

Within a [constant declaration](#Constant_declarations), the predeclared identifier `iota` represents successive untyped integer [constants](#Constants). Its value is the index of the respective [ConstSpec](#ConstSpec) in that constant declaration, starting at zero. It can be used to construct a set of related constants:

const (
	c0 = iota  // c0 == 0
	c1 = iota  // c1 == 1
	c2 = iota  // c2 == 2
)

const (
	a = 1 << iota  // a == 1  (iota == 0)
	b = 1 << iota  // b == 2  (iota == 1)
	c = 3          // c == 3  (iota == 2, unused)
	d = 1 << iota  // d == 8  (iota == 3)
)

const (
	u         = iota \* 42  // u == 0     (untyped integer constant)
	v float64 = iota \* 42  // v == 42.0  (float64 constant)
	w         = iota \* 42  // w == 84    (untyped integer constant)
)

const x = iota  // x == 0
const y = iota  // y == 0

By definition, multiple uses of `iota` in the same ConstSpec all have the same value:

const (
	bit0, mask0 = 1 << iota, 1<<iota - 1  // bit0 == 1, mask0 == 0  (iota == 0)
	bit1, mask1                           // bit1 == 2, mask1 == 1  (iota == 1)
	\_, \_                                  //                        (iota == 2, unused)
	bit3, mask3                           // bit3 == 8, mask3 == 7  (iota == 3)
)

This last example exploits the [implicit repetition](#Constant_declarations) of the last non-empty expression list.

### Type declarations

A type declaration binds an identifier, the _type name_, to a [type](#Types). Type declarations come in two forms: alias declarations and type definitions.

TypeDecl = "type" ( [TypeSpec](#TypeSpec) | "(" { [TypeSpec](#TypeSpec) ";" } ")" ) .
TypeSpec = [AliasDecl](#AliasDecl) | [TypeDef](#TypeDef) .

#### Alias declarations

An alias declaration binds an identifier to the given type.

AliasDecl = [identifier](#identifier) "=" [Type](#Type) .

Within the [scope](#Declarations_and_scope) of the identifier, it serves as an _alias_ for the type.

type (
	nodeList = \[\]\*Node  // nodeList and \[\]\*Node are identical types
	Polar    = polar    // Polar and polar denote identical types
)

#### Type definitions

A type definition creates a new, distinct type with the same [underlying type](#Types) and operations as the given type and binds an identifier, the _type name_, to it.

TypeDef = [identifier](#identifier) \[ [TypeParameters](#TypeParameters) \] [Type](#Type) .

The new type is called a _defined type_. It is [different](#Type_identity) from any other type, including the type it is created from.

type (
	Point struct{ x, y float64 }  // Point and struct{ x, y float64 } are different types
	polar Point                   // polar and Point denote different types
)

type TreeNode struct {
	left, right \*TreeNode
	value any
}

type Block interface {
	BlockSize() int
	Encrypt(src, dst \[\]byte)
	Decrypt(src, dst \[\]byte)
}

A defined type may have [methods](#Method_declarations) associated with it. It does not inherit any methods bound to the given type, but the [method set](#Method_sets) of an interface type or of elements of a composite type remains unchanged:

// A Mutex is a data type with two methods, Lock and Unlock.
type Mutex struct         { /\* Mutex fields \*/ }
func (m \*Mutex) Lock()    { /\* Lock implementation \*/ }
func (m \*Mutex) Unlock()  { /\* Unlock implementation \*/ }

// NewMutex has the same composition as Mutex but its method set is empty.
type NewMutex Mutex

// The method set of PtrMutex's underlying type \*Mutex remains unchanged,
// but the method set of PtrMutex is empty.
type PtrMutex \*Mutex

// The method set of \*PrintableMutex contains the methods
// Lock and Unlock bound to its embedded field Mutex.
type PrintableMutex struct {
	Mutex
}

// MyBlock is an interface type that has the same method set as Block.
type MyBlock Block

Type definitions may be used to define different boolean, numeric, or string types and associate methods with them:

type TimeZone int

const (
	EST TimeZone = -(5 + iota)
	CST
	MST
	PST
)

func (tz TimeZone) String() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("GMT%+dh", tz)
}

If the type definition specifies [type parameters](#Type_parameter_declarations), the type name denotes a _generic type_. Generic types must be [instantiated](#Instantiations) when they are used.

type List\[T any\] struct {
	next  \*List\[T\]
	value T
}

In a type definition the given type cannot be a type parameter.

type T\[P any\] P    // illegal: P is a type parameter

func f\[T any\]() {
	type L T   // illegal: T is a type parameter declared by the enclosing function
}

A generic type may also have [methods](#Method_declarations) associated with it. In this case, the method receivers must declare the same number of type parameters as present in the generic type definition.

// The method Len returns the number of elements in the linked list l.
func (l \*List\[T\]) Len() int  { … }

### Type parameter declarations

A type parameter list declares the _type parameters_ of a generic function or type declaration. The type parameter list looks like an ordinary [function parameter list](#Function_types) except that the type parameter names must all be present and the list is enclosed in square brackets rather than parentheses.

TypeParameters  = "\[" [TypeParamList](#TypeParamList) \[ "," \] "\]" .
TypeParamList   = [TypeParamDecl](#TypeParamDecl) { "," [TypeParamDecl](#TypeParamDecl) } .
TypeParamDecl   = [IdentifierList](#IdentifierList) [TypeConstraint](#TypeConstraint) .

All non-blank names in the list must be unique. Each name declares a type parameter, which is a new and different [named type](#Types) that acts as a place holder for an (as of yet) unknown type in the declaration. The type parameter is replaced with a _type argument_ upon [instantiation](#Instantiations) of the generic function or type.

\[P any\]
\[S interface{ ~\[\]byte|string }\]
\[S ~\[\]E, E any\]
\[P Constraint\[int\]\]
\[\_ any\]

Just as each ordinary function parameter has a parameter type, each type parameter has a corresponding (meta-)type which is called its [_type constraint_](#Type_constraints).

A parsing ambiguity arises when the type parameter list for a generic type declares a single type parameter `P` with a constraint `C` such that the text `P C` forms a valid expression:

type T\[P \*C\] …
type T\[P (C)\] …
type T\[P \*C|Q\] …
…

In these rare cases, the type parameter list is indistinguishable from an expression and the type declaration is parsed as an array type declaration. To resolve the ambiguity, embed the constraint in an [interface](#Interface_types) or use a trailing comma:

type T\[P interface{\*C}\] …
type T\[P \*C,\] …

Type parameters may also be declared by the receiver specification of a [method declaration](#Method_declarations) associated with a generic type.

#### Type constraints

A type constraint is an [interface](#Interface_types) that defines the set of permissible type arguments for the respective type parameter and controls the operations supported by values of that type parameter.

TypeConstraint = [TypeElem](#TypeElem) .

If the constraint is an interface literal of the form `interface{E}` where `E` is an embedded type element (not a method), in a type parameter list the enclosing `interface{ … }` may be omitted for convenience:

\[T \[\]P\]                      // = \[T interface{\[\]P}\]
\[T ~int\]                     // = \[T interface{~int}\]
\[T int|string\]               // = \[T interface{int|string}\]
type Constraint ~int         // illegal: ~int is not inside a type parameter list

The [predeclared](#Predeclared_identifiers) [interface type](#Interface_types) `comparable` denotes the set of all non-interface types that are [comparable](#Comparison_operators). Specifically, a type `T` implements `comparable` if:

*   `T` is not an interface type and `T` supports the operations `==` and `!=`; or
*   `T` is an interface type and each type in `T`'s [type set](#Interface_types) implements `comparable`.

Even though interfaces that are not type parameters can be [compared](#Comparison_operators) (possibly causing a run-time panic) they do not implement `comparable`.

int                          // implements comparable
\[\]byte                       // does not implement comparable (slices cannot be compared)
interface{}                  // does not implement comparable (see above)
interface{ ~int | ~string }  // type parameter only: implements comparable
interface{ comparable }      // type parameter only: implements comparable
interface{ ~int | ~\[\]byte }  // type parameter only: does not implement comparable (not all types in the type set are comparable)

The `comparable` interface and interfaces that (directly or indirectly) embed `comparable` may only be used as type constraints. They cannot be the types of values or variables, or components of other, non-interface types.

### Variable declarations

A variable declaration creates one or more [variables](#Variables), binds corresponding identifiers to them, and gives each a type and an initial value.

VarDecl     = "var" ( [VarSpec](#VarSpec) | "(" { [VarSpec](#VarSpec) ";" } ")" ) .
VarSpec     = [IdentifierList](#IdentifierList) ( [Type](#Type) \[ "=" [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) \] | "=" [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) ) .

var i int
var U, V, W float64
var k = 0
var x, y float32 = -1, -2
var (
	i       int
	u, v, s = 2.0, 3.0, "bar"
)
var re, im = complexSqrt(-1)
var \_, found = entries\[name\]  // map lookup; only interested in "found"

If a list of expressions is given, the variables are initialized with the expressions following the rules for [assignments](#Assignments). Otherwise, each variable is initialized to its [zero value](#The_zero_value).

If a type is present, each variable is given that type. Otherwise, each variable is given the type of the corresponding initialization value in the assignment. If that value is an untyped constant, it is first implicitly [converted](#Conversions) to its [default type](#Constants); if it is an untyped boolean value, it is first implicitly converted to type `bool`. The predeclared value `nil` cannot be used to initialize a variable with no explicit type.

var d = math.Sin(0.5)  // d is float64
var i = 42             // i is int
var t, ok = x.(T)      // t is T, ok is bool
var n = nil            // illegal

Implementation restriction: A compiler may make it illegal to declare a variable inside a [function body](#Function_declarations) if the variable is never used.

### Short variable declarations

A _short variable declaration_ uses the syntax:

ShortVarDecl = [IdentifierList](#IdentifierList) ":=" [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) .

It is shorthand for a regular [variable declaration](#Variable_declarations) with initializer expressions but no types:

"var" IdentifierList = ExpressionList .

i, j := 0, 10
f := func() int { return 7 }
ch := make(chan int)
r, w, \_ := os.Pipe()  // os.Pipe() returns a connected pair of Files and an error, if any
\_, y, \_ := coord(p)   // coord() returns three values; only interested in y coordinate

Unlike regular variable declarations, a short variable declaration may _redeclare_ variables provided they were originally declared earlier in the same block (or the parameter lists if the block is the function body) with the same type, and at least one of the non-[blank](#Blank_identifier) variables is new. As a consequence, redeclaration can only appear in a multi-variable short declaration. Redeclaration does not introduce a new variable; it just assigns a new value to the original.

field1, offset := nextField(str, 0)
field2, offset := nextField(str, offset)  // redeclares offset
a, a := 1, 2                              // illegal: double declaration of a or no new variable if a was declared elsewhere

Short variable declarations may appear only inside functions. In some contexts such as the initializers for ["if"](#If_statements), ["for"](#For_statements), or ["switch"](#Switch_statements) statements, they can be used to declare local temporary variables.

### Function declarations

A function declaration binds an identifier, the _function name_, to a function.

FunctionDecl = "func" [FunctionName](#FunctionName) \[ [TypeParameters](#TypeParameters) \] [Signature](#Signature) \[ [FunctionBody](#FunctionBody) \] .
FunctionName = [identifier](#identifier) .
FunctionBody = [Block](#Block) .

If the function's [signature](#Function_types) declares result parameters, the function body's statement list must end in a [terminating statement](#Terminating_statements).

func IndexRune(s string, r rune) int {
	for i, c := range s {
		if c == r {
			return i
		}
	}
	// invalid: missing return statement
}

If the function declaration specifies [type parameters](#Type_parameter_declarations), the function name denotes a _generic function_. A generic function must be [instantiated](#Instantiations) before it can be called or used as a value.

func min\[T ~int|~float64\](x, y T) T {
	if x < y {
		return x
	}
	return y
}

A function declaration without type parameters may omit the body. Such a declaration provides the signature for a function implemented outside Go, such as an assembly routine.

func flushICache(begin, end uintptr)  // implemented externally

### Method declarations

A method is a [function](#Function_declarations) with a _receiver_. A method declaration binds an identifier, the _method name_, to a method, and associates the method with the receiver's _base type_.

MethodDecl = "func" [Receiver](#Receiver) [MethodName](#MethodName) [Signature](#Signature) \[ [FunctionBody](#FunctionBody) \] .
Receiver   = [Parameters](#Parameters) .

The receiver is specified via an extra parameter section preceding the method name. That parameter section must declare a single non-variadic parameter, the receiver. Its type must be a [defined](#Type_definitions) type `T` or a pointer to a defined type `T`, possibly followed by a list of type parameter names `[P1, P2, …]` enclosed in square brackets. `T` is called the receiver _base type_. A receiver base type cannot be a pointer or interface type and it must be defined in the same package as the method. The method is said to be _bound_ to its receiver base type and the method name is visible only within [selectors](#Selectors) for type `T` or `*T`.

A non-[blank](#Blank_identifier) receiver identifier must be [unique](#Uniqueness_of_identifiers) in the method signature. If the receiver's value is not referenced inside the body of the method, its identifier may be omitted in the declaration. The same applies in general to parameters of functions and methods.

For a base type, the non-blank names of methods bound to it must be unique. If the base type is a [struct type](#Struct_types), the non-blank method and field names must be distinct.

Given defined type `Point` the declarations

func (p \*Point) Length() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(p.x \* p.x + p.y \* p.y)
}

func (p \*Point) Scale(factor float64) {
	p.x \*= factor
	p.y \*= factor
}

bind the methods `Length` and `Scale`, with receiver type `*Point`, to the base type `Point`.

If the receiver base type is a [generic type](#Type_declarations), the receiver specification must declare corresponding type parameters for the method to use. This makes the receiver type parameters available to the method. Syntactically, this type parameter declaration looks like an [instantiation](#Instantiations) of the receiver base type: the type arguments must be identifiers denoting the type parameters being declared, one for each type parameter of the receiver base type. The type parameter names do not need to match their corresponding parameter names in the receiver base type definition, and all non-blank parameter names must be unique in the receiver parameter section and the method signature. The receiver type parameter constraints are implied by the receiver base type definition: corresponding type parameters have corresponding constraints.

type Pair\[A, B any\] struct {
	a A
	b B
}

func (p Pair\[A, B\]) Swap() Pair\[B, A\]  { … }  // receiver declares A, B
func (p Pair\[First, \_\]) First() First  { … }  // receiver declares First, corresponds to A in Pair

Expressions
-----------

An expression specifies the computation of a value by applying operators and functions to operands.

### Operands

Operands denote the elementary values in an expression. An operand may be a literal, a (possibly [qualified](#Qualified_identifiers)) non-[blank](#Blank_identifier) identifier denoting a [constant](#Constant_declarations), [variable](#Variable_declarations), or [function](#Function_declarations), or a parenthesized expression.

Operand     = [Literal](#Literal) | [OperandName](#OperandName) \[ [TypeArgs](#TypeArgs) \] | "(" [Expression](#Expression) ")" .
Literal     = [BasicLit](#BasicLit) | [CompositeLit](#CompositeLit) | [FunctionLit](#FunctionLit) .
BasicLit    = [int\_lit](#int_lit) | [float\_lit](#float_lit) | [imaginary\_lit](#imaginary_lit) | [rune\_lit](#rune_lit) | [string\_lit](#string_lit) .
OperandName = [identifier](#identifier) | [QualifiedIdent](#QualifiedIdent) .

An operand name denoting a [generic function](#Function_declarations) may be followed by a list of [type arguments](#Instantiations); the resulting operand is an [instantiated](#Instantiations) function.

The [blank identifier](#Blank_identifier) may appear as an operand only on the left-hand side of an [assignment](#Assignments).

Implementation restriction: A compiler need not report an error if an operand's type is a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations) with an empty [type set](#Interface_types). Functions with such type parameters cannot be [instantiated](#Instantiations); any attempt will lead to an error at the instantiation site.

### Qualified identifiers

A _qualified identifier_ is an identifier qualified with a package name prefix. Both the package name and the identifier must not be [blank](#Blank_identifier).

QualifiedIdent = [PackageName](#PackageName) "." [identifier](#identifier) .

A qualified identifier accesses an identifier in a different package, which must be [imported](#Import_declarations). The identifier must be [exported](#Exported_identifiers) and declared in the [package block](#Blocks) of that package.

math.Sin	// denotes the Sin function in package math

### Composite literals

Composite literals construct new composite values each time they are evaluated. They consist of the type of the literal followed by a brace-bound list of elements. Each element may optionally be preceded by a corresponding key.

CompositeLit  = [LiteralType](#LiteralType) [LiteralValue](#LiteralValue) .
LiteralType   = [StructType](#StructType) | [ArrayType](#ArrayType) | "\[" "..." "\]" [ElementType](#ElementType) |
                [SliceType](#SliceType) | [MapType](#MapType) | [TypeName](#TypeName) .
LiteralValue  = "{" \[ [ElementList](#ElementList) \[ "," \] \] "}" .
ElementList   = [KeyedElement](#KeyedElement) { "," [KeyedElement](#KeyedElement) } .
KeyedElement  = \[ [Key](#Key) ":" \] [Element](#Element) .
Key           = [FieldName](#FieldName) | [Expression](#Expression) | [LiteralValue](#LiteralValue) .
FieldName     = [identifier](#identifier) .
Element       = [Expression](#Expression) | [LiteralValue](#LiteralValue) .

The LiteralType's [core type](#Core_types) `T` must be a struct, array, slice, or map type (the grammar enforces this constraint except when the type is given as a TypeName). The types of the elements and keys must be [assignable](#Assignability) to the respective field, element, and key types of type `T`; there is no additional conversion. The key is interpreted as a field name for struct literals, an index for array and slice literals, and a key for map literals. For map literals, all elements must have a key. It is an error to specify multiple elements with the same field name or constant key value. For non-constant map keys, see the section on [evaluation order](#Order_of_evaluation).

For struct literals the following rules apply:

*   A key must be a field name declared in the struct type.
*   An element list that does not contain any keys must list an element for each struct field in the order in which the fields are declared.
*   If any element has a key, every element must have a key.
*   An element list that contains keys does not need to have an element for each struct field. Omitted fields get the zero value for that field.
*   A literal may omit the element list; such a literal evaluates to the zero value for its type.
*   It is an error to specify an element for a non-exported field of a struct belonging to a different package.

Given the declarations

type Point3D struct { x, y, z float64 }
type Line struct { p, q Point3D }

one may write

origin := Point3D{}                            // zero value for Point3D
line := Line{origin, Point3D{y: -4, z: 12.3}}  // zero value for line.q.x

For array and slice literals the following rules apply:

*   Each element has an associated integer index marking its position in the array.
*   An element with a key uses the key as its index. The key must be a non-negative constant [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `int`; and if it is typed it must be of [integer type](#Numeric_types).
*   An element without a key uses the previous element's index plus one. If the first element has no key, its index is zero.

[Taking the address](#Address_operators) of a composite literal generates a pointer to a unique [variable](#Variables) initialized with the literal's value.

var pointer \*Point3D = &Point3D{y: 1000}

Note that the [zero value](#The_zero_value) for a slice or map type is not the same as an initialized but empty value of the same type. Consequently, taking the address of an empty slice or map composite literal does not have the same effect as allocating a new slice or map value with [new](#Allocation).

p1 := &\[\]int{}    // p1 points to an initialized, empty slice with value \[\]int{} and length 0
p2 := new(\[\]int)  // p2 points to an uninitialized slice with value nil and length 0

The length of an array literal is the length specified in the literal type. If fewer elements than the length are provided in the literal, the missing elements are set to the zero value for the array element type. It is an error to provide elements with index values outside the index range of the array. The notation `...` specifies an array length equal to the maximum element index plus one.

buffer := \[10\]string{}             // len(buffer) == 10
intSet := \[6\]int{1, 2, 3, 5}       // len(intSet) == 6
days := \[...\]string{"Sat", "Sun"}  // len(days) == 2

A slice literal describes the entire underlying array literal. Thus the length and capacity of a slice literal are the maximum element index plus one. A slice literal has the form

\[\]T{x1, x2, … xn}

and is shorthand for a slice operation applied to an array:

tmp := \[n\]T{x1, x2, … xn}
tmp\[0 : n\]

Within a composite literal of array, slice, or map type `T`, elements or map keys that are themselves composite literals may elide the respective literal type if it is identical to the element or key type of `T`. Similarly, elements or keys that are addresses of composite literals may elide the `&T` when the element or key type is `*T`.

\[...\]Point{{1.5, -3.5}, {0, 0}}     // same as \[...\]Point{Point{1.5, -3.5}, Point{0, 0}}
\[\]\[\]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}}          // same as \[\]\[\]int{\[\]int{1, 2, 3}, \[\]int{4, 5}}
\[\]\[\]Point{{{0, 1}, {1, 2}}}         // same as \[\]\[\]Point{\[\]Point{Point{0, 1}, Point{1, 2}}}
map\[string\]Point{"orig": {0, 0}}    // same as map\[string\]Point{"orig": Point{0, 0}}
map\[Point\]string{{0, 0}: "orig"}    // same as map\[Point\]string{Point{0, 0}: "orig"}

type PPoint \*Point
\[2\]\*Point{{1.5, -3.5}, {}}          // same as \[2\]\*Point{&Point{1.5, -3.5}, &Point{}}
\[2\]PPoint{{1.5, -3.5}, {}}          // same as \[2\]PPoint{PPoint(&Point{1.5, -3.5}), PPoint(&Point{})}

A parsing ambiguity arises when a composite literal using the TypeName form of the LiteralType appears as an operand between the [keyword](#Keywords) and the opening brace of the block of an "if", "for", or "switch" statement, and the composite literal is not enclosed in parentheses, square brackets, or curly braces. In this rare case, the opening brace of the literal is erroneously parsed as the one introducing the block of statements. To resolve the ambiguity, the composite literal must appear within parentheses.

if x == (T{a,b,c}\[i\]) { … }
if (x == T{a,b,c}\[i\]) { … }

Examples of valid array, slice, and map literals:

// list of prime numbers
primes := \[\]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2147483647}

// vowels\[ch\] is true if ch is a vowel
vowels := \[128\]bool{'a': true, 'e': true, 'i': true, 'o': true, 'u': true, 'y': true}

// the array \[10\]float32{-1, 0, 0, 0, -0.1, -0.1, 0, 0, 0, -1}
filter := \[10\]float32{-1, 4: -0.1, -0.1, 9: -1}

// frequencies in Hz for equal-tempered scale (A4 = 440Hz)
noteFrequency := map\[string\]float32{
	"C0": 16.35, "D0": 18.35, "E0": 20.60, "F0": 21.83,
	"G0": 24.50, "A0": 27.50, "B0": 30.87,
}

### Function literals

A function literal represents an anonymous [function](#Function_declarations). Function literals cannot declare type parameters.

FunctionLit = "func" [Signature](#Signature) [FunctionBody](#FunctionBody) .

func(a, b int, z float64) bool { return a\*b < int(z) }

A function literal can be assigned to a variable or invoked directly.

f := func(x, y int) int { return x + y }
func(ch chan int) { ch <- ACK }(replyChan)

Function literals are _closures_: they may refer to variables defined in a surrounding function. Those variables are then shared between the surrounding function and the function literal, and they survive as long as they are accessible.

### Primary expressions

Primary expressions are the operands for unary and binary expressions.

PrimaryExpr =
	[Operand](#Operand) |
	[Conversion](#Conversion) |
	[MethodExpr](#MethodExpr) |
	[PrimaryExpr](#PrimaryExpr) [Selector](#Selector) |
	[PrimaryExpr](#PrimaryExpr) [Index](#Index) |
	[PrimaryExpr](#PrimaryExpr) [Slice](#Slice) |
	[PrimaryExpr](#PrimaryExpr) [TypeAssertion](#TypeAssertion) |
	[PrimaryExpr](#PrimaryExpr) [Arguments](#Arguments) .

Selector       = "." [identifier](#identifier) .
Index          = "\[" [Expression](#Expression) "\]" .
Slice          = "\[" \[ [Expression](#Expression) \] ":" \[ [Expression](#Expression) \] "\]" |
                 "\[" \[ [Expression](#Expression) \] ":" [Expression](#Expression) ":" [Expression](#Expression) "\]" .
TypeAssertion  = "." "(" [Type](#Type) ")" .
Arguments      = "(" \[ ( [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) | [Type](#Type) \[ "," [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) \] ) \[ "..." \] \[ "," \] \] ")" .

x
2
(s + ".txt")
f(3.1415, true)
Point{1, 2}
m\["foo"\]
s\[i : j + 1\]
obj.color
f.p\[i\].x()

### Selectors

For a [primary expression](#Primary_expressions) `x` that is not a [package name](#Package_clause), the _selector expression_

x.f

denotes the field or method `f` of the value `x` (or sometimes `*x`; see below). The identifier `f` is called the (field or method) _selector_; it must not be the [blank identifier](#Blank_identifier). The type of the selector expression is the type of `f`. If `x` is a package name, see the section on [qualified identifiers](#Qualified_identifiers).

A selector `f` may denote a field or method `f` of a type `T`, or it may refer to a field or method `f` of a nested [embedded field](#Struct_types) of `T`. The number of embedded fields traversed to reach `f` is called its _depth_ in `T`. The depth of a field or method `f` declared in `T` is zero. The depth of a field or method `f` declared in an embedded field `A` in `T` is the depth of `f` in `A` plus one.

The following rules apply to selectors:

1.  For a value `x` of type `T` or `*T` where `T` is not a pointer or interface type, `x.f` denotes the field or method at the shallowest depth in `T` where there is such an `f`. If there is not exactly [one `f`](#Uniqueness_of_identifiers) with shallowest depth, the selector expression is illegal.
2.  For a value `x` of type `I` where `I` is an interface type, `x.f` denotes the actual method with name `f` of the dynamic value of `x`. If there is no method with name `f` in the [method set](#Method_sets) of `I`, the selector expression is illegal.
3.  As an exception, if the type of `x` is a [defined](#Type_definitions) pointer type and `(*x).f` is a valid selector expression denoting a field (but not a method), `x.f` is shorthand for `(*x).f`.
4.  In all other cases, `x.f` is illegal.
5.  If `x` is of pointer type and has the value `nil` and `x.f` denotes a struct field, assigning to or evaluating `x.f` causes a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics).
6.  If `x` is of interface type and has the value `nil`, [calling](#Calls) or [evaluating](#Method_values) the method `x.f` causes a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics).

For example, given the declarations:

type T0 struct {
	x int
}

func (\*T0) M0()

type T1 struct {
	y int
}

func (T1) M1()

type T2 struct {
	z int
	T1
	\*T0
}

func (\*T2) M2()

type Q \*T2

var t T2     // with t.T0 != nil
var p \*T2    // with p != nil and (\*p).T0 != nil
var q Q = p

one may write:

t.z          // t.z
t.y          // t.T1.y
t.x          // (\*t.T0).x

p.z          // (\*p).z
p.y          // (\*p).T1.y
p.x          // (\*(\*p).T0).x

q.x          // (\*(\*q).T0).x        (\*q).x is a valid field selector

p.M0()       // ((\*p).T0).M0()      M0 expects \*T0 receiver
p.M1()       // ((\*p).T1).M1()      M1 expects T1 receiver
p.M2()       // p.M2()              M2 expects \*T2 receiver
t.M2()       // (&t).M2()           M2 expects \*T2 receiver, see section on Calls

but the following is invalid:

q.M0()       // (\*q).M0 is valid but not a field selector

### Method expressions

If `M` is in the [method set](#Method_sets) of type `T`, `T.M` is a function that is callable as a regular function with the same arguments as `M` prefixed by an additional argument that is the receiver of the method.

MethodExpr    = [ReceiverType](#ReceiverType) "." [MethodName](#MethodName) .
ReceiverType  = [Type](#Type) .

Consider a struct type `T` with two methods, `Mv`, whose receiver is of type `T`, and `Mp`, whose receiver is of type `*T`.

type T struct {
	a int
}
func (tv  T) Mv(a int) int         { return 0 }  // value receiver
func (tp \*T) Mp(f float32) float32 { return 1 }  // pointer receiver

var t T

The expression

T.Mv

yields a function equivalent to `Mv` but with an explicit receiver as its first argument; it has signature

func(tv T, a int) int

That function may be called normally with an explicit receiver, so these five invocations are equivalent:

t.Mv(7)
T.Mv(t, 7)
(T).Mv(t, 7)
f1 := T.Mv; f1(t, 7)
f2 := (T).Mv; f2(t, 7)

Similarly, the expression

(\*T).Mp

yields a function value representing `Mp` with signature

func(tp \*T, f float32) float32

For a method with a value receiver, one can derive a function with an explicit pointer receiver, so

(\*T).Mv

yields a function value representing `Mv` with signature

func(tv \*T, a int) int

Such a function indirects through the receiver to create a value to pass as the receiver to the underlying method; the method does not overwrite the value whose address is passed in the function call.

The final case, a value-receiver function for a pointer-receiver method, is illegal because pointer-receiver methods are not in the method set of the value type.

Function values derived from methods are called with function call syntax; the receiver is provided as the first argument to the call. That is, given `f := T.Mv`, `f` is invoked as `f(t, 7)` not `t.f(7)`. To construct a function that binds the receiver, use a [function literal](#Function_literals) or [method value](#Method_values).

It is legal to derive a function value from a method of an interface type. The resulting function takes an explicit receiver of that interface type.

### Method values

If the expression `x` has static type `T` and `M` is in the [method set](#Method_sets) of type `T`, `x.M` is called a _method value_. The method value `x.M` is a function value that is callable with the same arguments as a method call of `x.M`. The expression `x` is evaluated and saved during the evaluation of the method value; the saved copy is then used as the receiver in any calls, which may be executed later.

type S struct { \*T }
type T int
func (t T) M() { print(t) }

t := new(T)
s := S{T: t}
f := t.M                    // receiver \*t is evaluated and stored in f
g := s.M                    // receiver \*(s.T) is evaluated and stored in g
\*t = 42                     // does not affect stored receivers in f and g

The type `T` may be an interface or non-interface type.

As in the discussion of [method expressions](#Method_expressions) above, consider a struct type `T` with two methods, `Mv`, whose receiver is of type `T`, and `Mp`, whose receiver is of type `*T`.

type T struct {
	a int
}
func (tv  T) Mv(a int) int         { return 0 }  // value receiver
func (tp \*T) Mp(f float32) float32 { return 1 }  // pointer receiver

var t T
var pt \*T
func makeT() T

The expression

t.Mv

yields a function value of type

func(int) int

These two invocations are equivalent:

t.Mv(7)
f := t.Mv; f(7)

Similarly, the expression

pt.Mp

yields a function value of type

func(float32) float32

As with [selectors](#Selectors), a reference to a non-interface method with a value receiver using a pointer will automatically dereference that pointer: `pt.Mv` is equivalent to `(*pt).Mv`.

As with [method calls](#Calls), a reference to a non-interface method with a pointer receiver using an addressable value will automatically take the address of that value: `t.Mp` is equivalent to `(&t).Mp`.

f := t.Mv; f(7)   // like t.Mv(7)
f := pt.Mp; f(7)  // like pt.Mp(7)
f := pt.Mv; f(7)  // like (\*pt).Mv(7)
f := t.Mp; f(7)   // like (&t).Mp(7)
f := makeT().Mp   // invalid: result of makeT() is not addressable

Although the examples above use non-interface types, it is also legal to create a method value from a value of interface type.

var i interface { M(int) } = myVal
f := i.M; f(7)  // like i.M(7)

### Index expressions

A primary expression of the form

a\[x\]

denotes the element of the array, pointer to array, slice, string or map `a` indexed by `x`. The value `x` is called the _index_ or _map key_, respectively. The following rules apply:

If `a` is neither a map nor a type parameter:

*   the index `x` must be an untyped constant or its [core type](#Core_types) must be an [integer](#Numeric_types)
*   a constant index must be non-negative and [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `int`
*   a constant index that is untyped is given type `int`
*   the index `x` is _in range_ if `0 <= x < len(a)`, otherwise it is _out of range_

For `a` of [array type](#Array_types) `A`:

*   a [constant](#Constants) index must be in range
*   if `x` is out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs
*   `a[x]` is the array element at index `x` and the type of `a[x]` is the element type of `A`

For `a` of [pointer](#Pointer_types) to array type:

*   `a[x]` is shorthand for `(*a)[x]`

For `a` of [slice type](#Slice_types) `S`:

*   if `x` is out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs
*   `a[x]` is the slice element at index `x` and the type of `a[x]` is the element type of `S`

For `a` of [string type](#String_types):

*   a [constant](#Constants) index must be in range if the string `a` is also constant
*   if `x` is out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs
*   `a[x]` is the non-constant byte value at index `x` and the type of `a[x]` is `byte`
*   `a[x]` may not be assigned to

For `a` of [map type](#Map_types) `M`:

*   `x`'s type must be [assignable](#Assignability) to the key type of `M`
*   if the map contains an entry with key `x`, `a[x]` is the map element with key `x` and the type of `a[x]` is the element type of `M`
*   if the map is `nil` or does not contain such an entry, `a[x]` is the [zero value](#The_zero_value) for the element type of `M`

For `a` of [type parameter type](#Type_parameter_declarations) `P`:

*   The index expression `a[x]` must be valid for values of all types in `P`'s type set.
*   The element types of all types in `P`'s type set must be identical. In this context, the element type of a string type is `byte`.
*   If there is a map type in the type set of `P`, all types in that type set must be map types, and the respective key types must be all identical.
*   `a[x]` is the array, slice, or string element at index `x`, or the map element with key `x` of the type argument that `P` is instantiated with, and the type of `a[x]` is the type of the (identical) element types.
*   `a[x]` may not be assigned to if `P`'s type set includes string types.

Otherwise `a[x]` is illegal.

An index expression on a map `a` of type `map[K]V` used in an [assignment](#Assignments) or initialization of the special form

v, ok = a\[x\]
v, ok := a\[x\]
var v, ok = a\[x\]

yields an additional untyped boolean value. The value of `ok` is `true` if the key `x` is present in the map, and `false` otherwise.

Assigning to an element of a `nil` map causes a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics).

### Slice expressions

Slice expressions construct a substring or slice from a string, array, pointer to array, or slice. There are two variants: a simple form that specifies a low and high bound, and a full form that also specifies a bound on the capacity.

#### Simple slice expressions

The primary expression

a\[low : high\]

constructs a substring or slice. The [core type](#Core_types) of `a` must be a string, array, pointer to array, or slice. The _indices_ `low` and `high` select which elements of operand `a` appear in the result. The result has indices starting at 0 and length equal to `high` - `low`. After slicing the array `a`

a := \[5\]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
s := a\[1:4\]

the slice `s` has type `[]int`, length 3, capacity 4, and elements

s\[0\] == 2
s\[1\] == 3
s\[2\] == 4

For convenience, any of the indices may be omitted. A missing `low` index defaults to zero; a missing `high` index defaults to the length of the sliced operand:

a\[2:\]  // same as a\[2 : len(a)\]
a\[:3\]  // same as a\[0 : 3\]
a\[:\]   // same as a\[0 : len(a)\]

If `a` is a pointer to an array, `a[low : high]` is shorthand for `(*a)[low : high]`.

For arrays or strings, the indices are _in range_ if `0` <= `low` <= `high` <= `len(a)`, otherwise they are _out of range_. For slices, the upper index bound is the slice capacity `cap(a)` rather than the length. A [constant](#Constants) index must be non-negative and [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `int`; for arrays or constant strings, constant indices must also be in range. If both indices are constant, they must satisfy `low <= high`. If the indices are out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs.

Except for [untyped strings](#Constants), if the sliced operand is a string or slice, the result of the slice operation is a non-constant value of the same type as the operand. For untyped string operands the result is a non-constant value of type `string`. If the sliced operand is an array, it must be [addressable](#Address_operators) and the result of the slice operation is a slice with the same element type as the array.

If the sliced operand of a valid slice expression is a `nil` slice, the result is a `nil` slice. Otherwise, if the result is a slice, it shares its underlying array with the operand.

var a \[10\]int
s1 := a\[3:7\]   // underlying array of s1 is array a; &s1\[2\] == &a\[5\]
s2 := s1\[1:4\]  // underlying array of s2 is underlying array of s1 which is array a; &s2\[1\] == &a\[5\]
s2\[1\] = 42     // s2\[1\] == s1\[2\] == a\[5\] == 42; they all refer to the same underlying array element

#### Full slice expressions

The primary expression

a\[low : high : max\]

constructs a slice of the same type, and with the same length and elements as the simple slice expression `a[low : high]`. Additionally, it controls the resulting slice's capacity by setting it to `max - low`. Only the first index may be omitted; it defaults to 0. The [core type](#Core_types) of `a` must be an array, pointer to array, or slice (but not a string). After slicing the array `a`

a := \[5\]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
t := a\[1:3:5\]

the slice `t` has type `[]int`, length 2, capacity 4, and elements

t\[0\] == 2
t\[1\] == 3

As for simple slice expressions, if `a` is a pointer to an array, `a[low : high : max]` is shorthand for `(*a)[low : high : max]`. If the sliced operand is an array, it must be [addressable](#Address_operators).

The indices are _in range_ if `0 <= low <= high <= max <= cap(a)`, otherwise they are _out of range_. A [constant](#Constants) index must be non-negative and [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `int`; for arrays, constant indices must also be in range. If multiple indices are constant, the constants that are present must be in range relative to each other. If the indices are out of range at run time, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs.

### Type assertions

For an expression `x` of [interface type](#Interface_types), but not a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), and a type `T`, the primary expression

x.(T)

asserts that `x` is not `nil` and that the value stored in `x` is of type `T`. The notation `x.(T)` is called a _type assertion_.

More precisely, if `T` is not an interface type, `x.(T)` asserts that the dynamic type of `x` is [identical](#Type_identity) to the type `T`. In this case, `T` must [implement](#Method_sets) the (interface) type of `x`; otherwise the type assertion is invalid since it is not possible for `x` to store a value of type `T`. If `T` is an interface type, `x.(T)` asserts that the dynamic type of `x` [implements](#Implementing_an_interface) the interface `T`.

If the type assertion holds, the value of the expression is the value stored in `x` and its type is `T`. If the type assertion is false, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs. In other words, even though the dynamic type of `x` is known only at run time, the type of `x.(T)` is known to be `T` in a correct program.

var x interface{} = 7          // x has dynamic type int and value 7
i := x.(int)                   // i has type int and value 7

type I interface { m() }

func f(y I) {
	s := y.(string)        // illegal: string does not implement I (missing method m)
	r := y.(io.Reader)     // r has type io.Reader and the dynamic type of y must implement both I and io.Reader
	…
}

A type assertion used in an [assignment](#Assignments) or initialization of the special form

v, ok = x.(T)
v, ok := x.(T)
var v, ok = x.(T)
var v, ok interface{} = x.(T) // dynamic types of v and ok are T and bool

yields an additional untyped boolean value. The value of `ok` is `true` if the assertion holds. Otherwise it is `false` and the value of `v` is the [zero value](#The_zero_value) for type `T`. No [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs in this case.

### Calls

Given an expression `f` with a [core type](#Core_types) `F` of [function type](#Function_types),

f(a1, a2, … an)

calls `f` with arguments `a1, a2, … an`. Except for one special case, arguments must be single-valued expressions [assignable](#Assignability) to the parameter types of `F` and are evaluated before the function is called. The type of the expression is the result type of `F`. A method invocation is similar but the method itself is specified as a selector upon a value of the receiver type for the method.

math.Atan2(x, y)  // function call
var pt \*Point
pt.Scale(3.5)     // method call with receiver pt

If `f` denotes a generic function, it must be [instantiated](#Instantiations) before it can be called or used as a function value.

In a function call, the function value and arguments are evaluated in [the usual order](#Order_of_evaluation). After they are evaluated, the parameters of the call are passed by value to the function and the called function begins execution. The return parameters of the function are passed by value back to the caller when the function returns.

Calling a `nil` function value causes a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics).

As a special case, if the return values of a function or method `g` are equal in number and individually assignable to the parameters of another function or method `f`, then the call `f(g(_parameters_of_g_))` will invoke `f` after binding the return values of `g` to the parameters of `f` in order. The call of `f` must contain no parameters other than the call of `g`, and `g` must have at least one return value. If `f` has a final `...` parameter, it is assigned the return values of `g` that remain after assignment of regular parameters.

func Split(s string, pos int) (string, string) {
	return s\[0:pos\], s\[pos:\]
}

func Join(s, t string) string {
	return s + t
}

if Join(Split(value, len(value)/2)) != value {
	log.Panic("test fails")
}

A method call `x.m()` is valid if the [method set](#Method_sets) of (the type of) `x` contains `m` and the argument list can be assigned to the parameter list of `m`. If `x` is [addressable](#Address_operators) and `&x`'s method set contains `m`, `x.m()` is shorthand for `(&x).m()`:

var p Point
p.Scale(3.5)

There is no distinct method type and there are no method literals.

### Passing arguments to `...` parameters

If `f` is [variadic](#Function_types) with a final parameter `p` of type `...T`, then within `f` the type of `p` is equivalent to type `[]T`. If `f` is invoked with no actual arguments for `p`, the value passed to `p` is `nil`. Otherwise, the value passed is a new slice of type `[]T` with a new underlying array whose successive elements are the actual arguments, which all must be [assignable](#Assignability) to `T`. The length and capacity of the slice is therefore the number of arguments bound to `p` and may differ for each call site.

Given the function and calls

func Greeting(prefix string, who ...string)
Greeting("nobody")
Greeting("hello:", "Joe", "Anna", "Eileen")

within `Greeting`, `who` will have the value `nil` in the first call, and `[]string{"Joe", "Anna", "Eileen"}` in the second.

If the final argument is assignable to a slice type `[]T` and is followed by `...`, it is passed unchanged as the value for a `...T` parameter. In this case no new slice is created.

Given the slice `s` and call

s := \[\]string{"James", "Jasmine"}
Greeting("goodbye:", s...)

within `Greeting`, `who` will have the same value as `s` with the same underlying array.

### Instantiations

A generic function or type is _instantiated_ by substituting _type arguments_ for the type parameters. Instantiation proceeds in two steps:

1.  Each type argument is substituted for its corresponding type parameter in the generic declaration. This substitution happens across the entire function or type declaration, including the type parameter list itself and any types in that list.
2.  After substitution, each type argument must [implement](#Interface_types) the [constraint](#Type_parameter_declarations) (instantiated, if necessary) of the corresponding type parameter. Otherwise instantiation fails.

Instantiating a type results in a new non-generic [named type](#Types); instantiating a function produces a new non-generic function.

type parameter list    type arguments    after substitution

\[P any\]                int               int implements any
\[S ~\[\]E, E any\]        \[\]int, int        \[\]int implements ~\[\]int, int implements any
\[P io.Writer\]          string            illegal: string doesn't implement io.Writer

For a generic function, type arguments may be provided explicitly, or they may be partially or completely [inferred](#Type_inference). A generic function that is is _not_ [called](#Calls) requires a type argument list for instantiation; if the list is partial, all remaining type arguments must be inferrable. A generic function that is called may provide a (possibly partial) type argument list, or may omit it entirely if the omitted type arguments are inferrable from the ordinary (non-type) function arguments.

func min\[T ~int|~float64\](x, y T) T { … }

f := min                   // illegal: min must be instantiated with type arguments when used without being called
minInt := min\[int\]         // minInt has type func(x, y int) int
a := minInt(2, 3)          // a has value 2 of type int
b := min\[float64\](2.0, 3)  // b has value 2.0 of type float64
c := min(b, -1)            // c has value -1.0 of type float64

A partial type argument list cannot be empty; at least the first argument must be present. The list is a prefix of the full list of type arguments, leaving the remaining arguments to be inferred. Loosely speaking, type arguments may be omitted from "right to left".

func apply\[S ~\[\]E, E any\](s S, f(E) E) S { … }

f0 := apply\[\]                  // illegal: type argument list cannot be empty
f1 := apply\[\[\]int\]             // type argument for S explicitly provided, type argument for E inferred
f2 := apply\[\[\]string, string\]  // both type arguments explicitly provided

var bytes \[\]byte
r := apply(bytes, func(byte) byte { … })  // both type arguments inferred from the function arguments

For a generic type, all type arguments must always be provided explicitly.

### Type inference

Missing function type arguments may be _inferred_ by a series of steps, described below. Each step attempts to use known information to infer additional type arguments. Type inference stops as soon as all type arguments are known. After type inference is complete, it is still necessary to substitute all type arguments for type parameters and verify that each type argument [implements](#Implementing_an_interface) the relevant constraint; it is possible for an inferred type argument to fail to implement a constraint, in which case instantiation fails.

Type inference is based on

*   a [type parameter list](#Type_parameter_declarations)
*   a substitution map _M_ initialized with the known type arguments, if any
*   a (possibly empty) list of ordinary function arguments (in case of a function call only)

and then proceeds with the following steps:

1.  apply [_function argument type inference_](#Function_argument_type_inference) to all _typed_ ordinary function arguments
2.  apply [_constraint type inference_](#Constraint_type_inference)
3.  apply function argument type inference to all _untyped_ ordinary function arguments using the default type for each of the untyped function arguments
4.  apply constraint type inference

If there are no ordinary or untyped function arguments, the respective steps are skipped. Constraint type inference is skipped if the previous step didn't infer any new type arguments, but it is run at least once if there are missing type arguments.

The substitution map _M_ is carried through all steps, and each step may add entries to _M_. The process stops as soon as _M_ has a type argument for each type parameter or if an inference step fails. If an inference step fails, or if _M_ is still missing type arguments after the last step, type inference fails.

#### Type unification

Type inference is based on _type unification_. A single unification step applies to a [substitution map](#Type_inference) and two types, either or both of which may be or contain type parameters. The substitution map tracks the known (explicitly provided or already inferred) type arguments: the map contains an entry `P` → `A` for each type parameter `P` and corresponding known type argument `A`. During unification, known type arguments take the place of their corresponding type parameters when comparing types. Unification is the process of finding substitution map entries that make the two types equivalent.

For unification, two types that don't contain any type parameters from the current type parameter list are _equivalent_ if they are identical, or if they are channel types that are identical ignoring channel direction, or if their underlying types are equivalent.

Unification works by comparing the structure of pairs of types: their structure disregarding type parameters must be identical, and types other than type parameters must be equivalent. A type parameter in one type may match any complete subtype in the other type; each successful match causes an entry to be added to the substitution map. If the structure differs, or types other than type parameters are not equivalent, unification fails.

For example, if `T1` and `T2` are type parameters, `[]map[int]bool` can be unified with any of the following:

\[\]map\[int\]bool   // types are identical
T1               // adds T1 → \[\]map\[int\]bool to substitution map
\[\]T1             // adds T1 → map\[int\]bool to substitution map
\[\]map\[T1\]T2      // adds T1 → int and T2 → bool to substitution map

On the other hand, `[]map[int]bool` cannot be unified with any of

int              // int is not a slice
struct{}         // a struct is not a slice
\[\]struct{}       // a struct is not a map
\[\]map\[T1\]string  // map element types don't match

As an exception to this general rule, because a [defined type](#Type_definitions) `D` and a type literal `L` are never equivalent, unification compares the underlying type of `D` with `L` instead. For example, given the defined type

type Vector \[\]float64

and the type literal `[]E`, unification compares `[]float64` with `[]E` and adds an entry `E` → `float64` to the substitution map.

#### Function argument type inference

Function argument type inference infers type arguments from function arguments: if a function parameter is declared with a type `T` that uses type parameters, [unifying](#Type_unification) the type of the corresponding function argument with `T` may infer type arguments for the type parameters used by `T`.

For instance, given the generic function

func scale\[Number ~int64|~float64|~complex128\](v \[\]Number, s Number) \[\]Number

and the call

var vector \[\]float64
scaledVector := scale(vector, 42)

the type argument for `Number` can be inferred from the function argument `vector` by unifying the type of `vector` with the corresponding parameter type: `[]float64` and `[]Number` match in structure and `float64` matches with `Number`. This adds the entry `Number` → `float64` to the [substitution map](#Type_unification). Untyped arguments, such as the second function argument `42` here, are ignored in the first round of function argument type inference and only considered if there are unresolved type parameters left.

Inference happens in two separate phases; each phase operates on a specific list of (parameter, argument) pairs:

1.  The list _Lt_ contains all (parameter, argument) pairs where the parameter type uses type parameters and where the function argument is _typed_.
2.  The list _Lu_ contains all remaining pairs where the parameter type is a single type parameter. In this list, the respective function arguments are untyped.

Any other (parameter, argument) pair is ignored.

By construction, the arguments of the pairs in _Lu_ are _untyped_ constants (or the untyped boolean result of a comparison). And because [default types](#Constants) of untyped values are always predeclared non-composite types, they can never match against a composite type, so it is sufficient to only consider parameter types that are single type parameters.

Each list is processed in a separate phase:

1.  In the first phase, the parameter and argument types of each pair in _Lt_ are unified. If unification succeeds for a pair, it may yield new entries that are added to the substitution map _M_. If unification fails, type inference fails.
2.  The second phase considers the entries of list _Lu_. Type parameters for which the type argument has already been determined are ignored in this phase. For each remaining pair, the parameter type (which is a single type parameter) and the [default type](#Constants) of the corresponding untyped argument is unified. If unification fails, type inference fails.

While unification is successful, processing of each list continues until all list elements are considered, even if all type arguments are inferred before the last list element has been processed.

Example:

func min\[T ~int|~float64\](x, y T) T

var x int
min(x, 2.0)    // T is int, inferred from typed argument x; 2.0 is assignable to int
min(1.0, 2.0)  // T is float64, inferred from default type for 1.0 and matches default type for 2.0
min(1.0, 2)    // illegal: default type float64 (for 1.0) doesn't match default type int (for 2)

In the example `min(1.0, 2)`, processing the function argument `1.0` yields the substitution map entry `T` → `float64`. Because processing continues until all untyped arguments are considered, an error is reported. This ensures that type inference does not depend on the order of the untyped arguments.

#### Constraint type inference

Constraint type inference infers type arguments by considering type constraints. If a type parameter `P` has a constraint with a [core type](#Core_types) `C`, [unifying](#Type_unification) `P` with `C` may infer additional type arguments, either the type argument for `P`, or if that is already known, possibly the type arguments for type parameters used in `C`.

For instance, consider the type parameter list with type parameters `List` and `Elem`:

\[List ~\[\]Elem, Elem any\]

Constraint type inference can deduce the type of `Elem` from the type argument for `List` because `Elem` is a type parameter in the core type `[]Elem` of `List`. If the type argument is `Bytes`:

type Bytes \[\]byte

unifying the underlying type of `Bytes` with the core type means unifying `[]byte` with `[]Elem`. That unification succeeds and yields the [substitution map](#Type_unification) entry `Elem` → `byte`. Thus, in this example, constraint type inference can infer the second type argument from the first one.

Using the core type of a constraint may lose some information: In the (unlikely) case that the constraint's type set contains a single [defined type](#Type_definitions) `N`, the corresponding core type is `N`'s underlying type rather than `N` itself. In this case, constraint type inference may succeed but instantiation will fail because the inferred type is not in the type set of the constraint. Thus, constraint type inference uses the _adjusted core type_ of a constraint: if the type set contains a single type, use that type; otherwise use the constraint's core type.

Generally, constraint type inference proceeds in two phases: Starting with a given substitution map _M_

1.  For all type parameters with an adjusted core type, unify the type parameter with that type. If any unification fails, constraint type inference fails.
2.  At this point, some entries in _M_ may map type parameters to other type parameters or to types containing type parameters. For each entry `P` → `A` in _M_ where `A` is or contains type parameters `Q` for which there exist entries `Q` → `B` in _M_, substitute those `Q` with the respective `B` in `A`. Stop when no further substitution is possible.

The result of constraint type inference is the final substitution map _M_ from type parameters `P` to type arguments `A` where no type parameter `P` appears in any of the `A`.

For instance, given the type parameter list

\[A any, B \[\]C, C \*A\]

and the single provided type argument `int` for type parameter `A`, the initial substitution map _M_ contains the entry `A` → `int`.

In the first phase, the type parameters `B` and `C` are unified with the core type of their respective constraints. This adds the entries `B` → `[]C` and `C` → `*A` to _M_.

At this point there are two entries in _M_ where the right-hand side is or contains type parameters for which there exists other entries in _M_: `[]C` and `*A`. In the second phase, these type parameters are replaced with their respective types. It doesn't matter in which order this happens. Starting with the state of _M_ after the first phase:

`A` → `int`, `B` → `[]C`, `C` → `*A`

Replace `A` on the right-hand side of → with `int`:

`A` → `int`, `B` → `[]C`, `C` → `*int`

Replace `C` on the right-hand side of → with `*int`:

`A` → `int`, `B` → `[]*int`, `C` → `*int`

At this point no further substitution is possible and the map is full. Therefore, `M` represents the final map of type parameters to type arguments for the given type parameter list.

### Operators

Operators combine operands into expressions.

Expression = [UnaryExpr](#UnaryExpr) | [Expression](#Expression) [binary\_op](#binary_op) [Expression](#Expression) .
UnaryExpr  = [PrimaryExpr](#PrimaryExpr) | [unary\_op](#unary_op) [UnaryExpr](#UnaryExpr) .

binary\_op  = "||" | "&&" | [rel\_op](#rel_op) | [add\_op](#add_op) | [mul\_op](#mul_op) .
rel\_op     = "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" .
add\_op     = "+" | "-" | "|" | "^" .
mul\_op     = "\*" | "/" | "%" | "<<" | ">>" | "&" | "&^" .

unary\_op   = "+" | "-" | "!" | "^" | "\*" | "&" | "<-" .

Comparisons are discussed [elsewhere](#Comparison_operators). For other binary operators, the operand types must be [identical](#Type_identity) unless the operation involves shifts or untyped [constants](#Constants). For operations involving constants only, see the section on [constant expressions](#Constant_expressions).

Except for shift operations, if one operand is an untyped [constant](#Constants) and the other operand is not, the constant is implicitly [converted](#Conversions) to the type of the other operand.

The right operand in a shift expression must have [integer type](#Numeric_types) or be an untyped constant [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `uint`. If the left operand of a non-constant shift expression is an untyped constant, it is first implicitly converted to the type it would assume if the shift expression were replaced by its left operand alone.

var a \[1024\]byte
var s uint = 33

// The results of the following examples are given for 64-bit ints.
var i = 1<<s                   // 1 has type int
var j int32 = 1<<s             // 1 has type int32; j == 0
var k = uint64(1<<s)           // 1 has type uint64; k == 1<<33
var m int = 1.0<<s             // 1.0 has type int; m == 1<<33
var n = 1.0<<s == j            // 1.0 has type int32; n == true
var o = 1<<s == 2<<s           // 1 and 2 have type int; o == false
var p = 1<<s == 1<<33          // 1 has type int; p == true
var u = 1.0<<s                 // illegal: 1.0 has type float64, cannot shift
var u1 = 1.0<<s != 0           // illegal: 1.0 has type float64, cannot shift
var u2 = 1<<s != 1.0           // illegal: 1 has type float64, cannot shift
var v1 float32 = 1<<s          // illegal: 1 has type float32, cannot shift
var v2 = string(1<<s)          // illegal: 1 is converted to a string, cannot shift
var w int64 = 1.0<<33          // 1.0<<33 is a constant shift expression; w == 1<<33
var x = a\[1.0<<s\]              // panics: 1.0 has type int, but 1<<33 overflows array bounds
var b = make(\[\]byte, 1.0<<s)   // 1.0 has type int; len(b) == 1<<33

// The results of the following examples are given for 32-bit ints,
// which means the shifts will overflow.
var mm int = 1.0<<s            // 1.0 has type int; mm == 0
var oo = 1<<s == 2<<s          // 1 and 2 have type int; oo == true
var pp = 1<<s == 1<<33         // illegal: 1 has type int, but 1<<33 overflows int
var xx = a\[1.0<<s\]             // 1.0 has type int; xx == a\[0\]
var bb = make(\[\]byte, 1.0<<s)  // 1.0 has type int; len(bb) == 0

#### Operator precedence

Unary operators have the highest precedence. As the `++` and `--` operators form statements, not expressions, they fall outside the operator hierarchy. As a consequence, statement `*p++` is the same as `(*p)++`.

There are five precedence levels for binary operators. Multiplication operators bind strongest, followed by addition operators, comparison operators, `&&` (logical AND), and finally `||` (logical OR):

Precedence    Operator
    5             \*  /  %  <<  >>  &  &^
    4             +  -  |  ^
    3             ==  !=  <  <=  >  >=
    2             &&
    1             ||

Binary operators of the same precedence associate from left to right. For instance, `x / y * z` is the same as `(x / y) * z`.

+x
23 + 3\*x\[i\]
x <= f()
^a >> b
f() || g()
x == y+1 && <-chanInt > 0

### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators apply to numeric values and yield a result of the same type as the first operand. The four standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) apply to [integer](#Numeric_types), [floating-point](#Numeric_types), and [complex](#Numeric_types) types; `+` also applies to [strings](#String_types). The bitwise logical and shift operators apply to integers only.

\+    sum                    integers, floats, complex values, strings
-    difference             integers, floats, complex values
\*    product                integers, floats, complex values
/    quotient               integers, floats, complex values
%    remainder              integers

&    bitwise AND            integers
|    bitwise OR             integers
^    bitwise XOR            integers
&^   bit clear (AND NOT)    integers

<<   left shift             integer << integer >= 0
>>   right shift            integer >> integer >= 0

If the operand type is a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), the operator must apply to each type in that type set. The operands are represented as values of the type argument that the type parameter is [instantiated](#Instantiations) with, and the operation is computed with the precision of that type argument. For example, given the function:

func dotProduct\[F ~float32|~float64\](v1, v2 \[\]F) F {
	var s F
	for i, x := range v1 {
		y := v2\[i\]
		s += x \* y
	}
	return s
}

the product `x * y` and the addition `s += x * y` are computed with `float32` or `float64` precision, respectively, depending on the type argument for `F`.

#### Integer operators

For two integer values `x` and `y`, the integer quotient `q = x / y` and remainder `r = x % y` satisfy the following relationships:

x = q\*y + r  and  |r| < |y|

with `x / y` truncated towards zero (["truncated division"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)).

 x     y     x / y     x % y
 5     3       1         2
-5     3      -1        -2
 5    -3      -1         2
-5    -3       1        -2

The one exception to this rule is that if the dividend `x` is the most negative value for the int type of `x`, the quotient `q = x / -1` is equal to `x` (and `r = 0`) due to two's-complement [integer overflow](#Integer_overflow):

			 x, q
int8                     -128
int16                  -32768
int32             -2147483648
int64    -9223372036854775808

If the divisor is a [constant](#Constants), it must not be zero. If the divisor is zero at run time, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs. If the dividend is non-negative and the divisor is a constant power of 2, the division may be replaced by a right shift, and computing the remainder may be replaced by a bitwise AND operation:

 x     x / 4     x % 4     x >> 2     x & 3
 11      2         3         2          3
-11     -2        -3        -3          1

The shift operators shift the left operand by the shift count specified by the right operand, which must be non-negative. If the shift count is negative at run time, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs. The shift operators implement arithmetic shifts if the left operand is a signed integer and logical shifts if it is an unsigned integer. There is no upper limit on the shift count. Shifts behave as if the left operand is shifted `n` times by 1 for a shift count of `n`. As a result, `x << 1` is the same as `x*2` and `x >> 1` is the same as `x/2` but truncated towards negative infinity.

For integer operands, the unary operators `+`, `-`, and `^` are defined as follows:

+x                          is 0 + x
-x    negation              is 0 - x
^x    bitwise complement    is m ^ x  with m = "all bits set to 1" for unsigned x
                                      and  m = -1 for signed x

#### Integer overflow

For [unsigned integer](#Numeric_types) values, the operations `+`, `-`, `*`, and `<<` are computed modulo 2_n_, where _n_ is the bit width of the unsigned integer's type. Loosely speaking, these unsigned integer operations discard high bits upon overflow, and programs may rely on "wrap around".

For signed integers, the operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `<<` may legally overflow and the resulting value exists and is deterministically defined by the signed integer representation, the operation, and its operands. Overflow does not cause a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics). A compiler may not optimize code under the assumption that overflow does not occur. For instance, it may not assume that `x < x + 1` is always true.

#### Floating-point operators

For floating-point and complex numbers, `+x` is the same as `x`, while `-x` is the negation of `x`. The result of a floating-point or complex division by zero is not specified beyond the IEEE-754 standard; whether a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs is implementation-specific.

An implementation may combine multiple floating-point operations into a single fused operation, possibly across statements, and produce a result that differs from the value obtained by executing and rounding the instructions individually. An explicit [floating-point type](#Numeric_types) [conversion](#Conversions) rounds to the precision of the target type, preventing fusion that would discard that rounding.

For instance, some architectures provide a "fused multiply and add" (FMA) instruction that computes `x*y + z` without rounding the intermediate result `x*y`. These examples show when a Go implementation can use that instruction:

// FMA allowed for computing r, because x\*y is not explicitly rounded:
r  = x\*y + z
r  = z;   r += x\*y
t  = x\*y; r = t + z
\*p = x\*y; r = \*p + z
r  = x\*y + float64(z)

// FMA disallowed for computing r, because it would omit rounding of x\*y:
r  = float64(x\*y) + z
r  = z; r += float64(x\*y)
t  = float64(x\*y); r = t + z

#### String concatenation

Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator or the `+=` assignment operator:

s := "hi" + string(c)
s += " and good bye"

String addition creates a new string by concatenating the operands.

### Comparison operators

Comparison operators compare two operands and yield an untyped boolean value.

\==    equal
!=    not equal
<     less
<=    less or equal
>     greater
>=    greater or equal

In any comparison, the first operand must be [assignable](#Assignability) to the type of the second operand, or vice versa.

The equality operators `==` and `!=` apply to operands that are _comparable_. The ordering operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` apply to operands that are _ordered_. These terms and the result of the comparisons are defined as follows:

*   Boolean values are comparable. Two boolean values are equal if they are either both `true` or both `false`.
*   Integer values are comparable and ordered, in the usual way.
*   Floating-point values are comparable and ordered, as defined by the IEEE-754 standard.
*   Complex values are comparable. Two complex values `u` and `v` are equal if both `real(u) == real(v)` and `imag(u) == imag(v)`.
*   String values are comparable and ordered, lexically byte-wise.
*   Pointer values are comparable. Two pointer values are equal if they point to the same variable or if both have value `nil`. Pointers to distinct [zero-size](#Size_and_alignment_guarantees) variables may or may not be equal.
*   Channel values are comparable. Two channel values are equal if they were created by the same call to [`make`](#Making_slices_maps_and_channels) or if both have value `nil`.
*   Interface values are comparable. Two interface values are equal if they have [identical](#Type_identity) dynamic types and equal dynamic values or if both have value `nil`.
*   A value `x` of non-interface type `X` and a value `t` of interface type `T` are comparable when values of type `X` are comparable and `X` [implements](#Implementing_an_interface) `T`. They are equal if `t`'s dynamic type is identical to `X` and `t`'s dynamic value is equal to `x`.
*   Struct values are comparable if all their fields are comparable. Two struct values are equal if their corresponding non-[blank](#Blank_identifier) fields are equal.
*   Array values are comparable if values of the array element type are comparable. Two array values are equal if their corresponding elements are equal.

A comparison of two interface values with identical dynamic types causes a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) if values of that type are not comparable. This behavior applies not only to direct interface value comparisons but also when comparing arrays of interface values or structs with interface-valued fields.

Slice, map, and function values are not comparable. However, as a special case, a slice, map, or function value may be compared to the predeclared identifier `nil`. Comparison of pointer, channel, and interface values to `nil` is also allowed and follows from the general rules above.

const c = 3 < 4            // c is the untyped boolean constant true

type MyBool bool
var x, y int
var (
	// The result of a comparison is an untyped boolean.
	// The usual assignment rules apply.
	b3        = x == y // b3 has type bool
	b4 bool   = x == y // b4 has type bool
	b5 MyBool = x == y // b5 has type MyBool
)

### Logical operators

Logical operators apply to [boolean](#Boolean_types) values and yield a result of the same type as the operands. The right operand is evaluated conditionally.

&&    conditional AND    p && q  is  "if p then q else false"
||    conditional OR     p || q  is  "if p then true else q"
!     NOT                !p      is  "not p"

### Address operators

For an operand `x` of type `T`, the address operation `&x` generates a pointer of type `*T` to `x`. The operand must be _addressable_, that is, either a variable, pointer indirection, or slice indexing operation; or a field selector of an addressable struct operand; or an array indexing operation of an addressable array. As an exception to the addressability requirement, `x` may also be a (possibly parenthesized) [composite literal](#Composite_literals). If the evaluation of `x` would cause a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics), then the evaluation of `&x` does too.

For an operand `x` of pointer type `*T`, the pointer indirection `*x` denotes the [variable](#Variables) of type `T` pointed to by `x`. If `x` is `nil`, an attempt to evaluate `*x` will cause a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics).

&x
&a\[f(2)\]
&Point{2, 3}
\*p
\*pf(x)

var x \*int = nil
\*x   // causes a run-time panic
&\*x  // causes a run-time panic

### Receive operator

For an operand `ch` whose [core type](#Core_types) is a [channel](#Channel_types), the value of the receive operation `<-ch` is the value received from the channel `ch`. The channel direction must permit receive operations, and the type of the receive operation is the element type of the channel. The expression blocks until a value is available. Receiving from a `nil` channel blocks forever. A receive operation on a [closed](#Close) channel can always proceed immediately, yielding the element type's [zero value](#The_zero_value) after any previously sent values have been received.

v1 := <-ch
v2 = <-ch
f(<-ch)
<-strobe  // wait until clock pulse and discard received value

A receive expression used in an [assignment](#Assignments) or initialization of the special form

x, ok = <-ch
x, ok := <-ch
var x, ok = <-ch
var x, ok T = <-ch

yields an additional untyped boolean result reporting whether the communication succeeded. The value of `ok` is `true` if the value received was delivered by a successful send operation to the channel, or `false` if it is a zero value generated because the channel is closed and empty.

### Conversions

A conversion changes the [type](#Types) of an expression to the type specified by the conversion. A conversion may appear literally in the source, or it may be _implied_ by the context in which an expression appears.

An _explicit_ conversion is an expression of the form `T(x)` where `T` is a type and `x` is an expression that can be converted to type `T`.

Conversion = [Type](#Type) "(" [Expression](#Expression) \[ "," \] ")" .

If the type starts with the operator `*` or `<-`, or if the type starts with the keyword `func` and has no result list, it must be parenthesized when necessary to avoid ambiguity:

\*Point(p)        // same as \*(Point(p))
(\*Point)(p)      // p is converted to \*Point
<-chan int(c)    // same as <-(chan int(c))
(<-chan int)(c)  // c is converted to <-chan int
func()(x)        // function signature func() x
(func())(x)      // x is converted to func()
(func() int)(x)  // x is converted to func() int
func() int(x)    // x is converted to func() int (unambiguous)

A [constant](#Constants) value `x` can be converted to type `T` if `x` is [representable](#Representability) by a value of `T`. As a special case, an integer constant `x` can be explicitly converted to a [string type](#String_types) using the [same rule](#Conversions_to_and_from_a_string_type) as for non-constant `x`.

Converting a constant to a type that is not a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations) yields a typed constant.

uint(iota)               // iota value of type uint
float32(2.718281828)     // 2.718281828 of type float32
complex128(1)            // 1.0 + 0.0i of type complex128
float32(0.49999999)      // 0.5 of type float32
float64(-1e-1000)        // 0.0 of type float64
string('x')              // "x" of type string
string(0x266c)           // "♬" of type string
MyString("foo" + "bar")  // "foobar" of type MyString
string(\[\]byte{'a'})      // not a constant: \[\]byte{'a'} is not a constant
(\*int)(nil)              // not a constant: nil is not a constant, \*int is not a boolean, numeric, or string type
int(1.2)                 // illegal: 1.2 cannot be represented as an int
string(65.0)             // illegal: 65.0 is not an integer constant

Converting a constant to a type parameter yields a _non-constant_ value of that type, with the value represented as a value of the type argument that the type parameter is [instantiated](#Instantiations) with. For example, given the function:

func f\[P ~float32|~float64\]() {
	… P(1.1) …
}

the conversion `P(1.1)` results in a non-constant value of type `P` and the value `1.1` is represented as a `float32` or a `float64` depending on the type argument for `f`. Accordingly, if `f` is instantiated with a `float32` type, the numeric value of the expression `P(1.1) + 1.2` will be computed with the same precision as the corresponding non-constant `float32` addition.

A non-constant value `x` can be converted to type `T` in any of these cases:

*   `x` is [assignable](#Assignability) to `T`.
*   ignoring struct tags (see below), `x`'s type and `T` are not [type parameters](#Type_parameter_declarations) but have [identical](#Type_identity) [underlying types](#Types).
*   ignoring struct tags (see below), `x`'s type and `T` are pointer types that are not [named types](#Types), and their pointer base types are not type parameters but have identical underlying types.
*   `x`'s type and `T` are both integer or floating point types.
*   `x`'s type and `T` are both complex types.
*   `x` is an integer or a slice of bytes or runes and `T` is a string type.
*   `x` is a string and `T` is a slice of bytes or runes.
*   `x` is a slice, `T` is a pointer to an array, and the slice and array types have [identical](#Type_identity) element types.

Additionally, if `T` or `x`'s type `V` are type parameters, `x` can also be converted to type `T` if one of the following conditions applies:

*   Both `V` and `T` are type parameters and a value of each type in `V`'s type set can be converted to each type in `T`'s type set.
*   Only `V` is a type parameter and a value of each type in `V`'s type set can be converted to `T`.
*   Only `T` is a type parameter and `x` can be converted to each type in `T`'s type set.

[Struct tags](#Struct_types) are ignored when comparing struct types for identity for the purpose of conversion:

type Person struct {
	Name    string
	Address \*struct {
		Street string
		City   string
	}
}

var data \*struct {
	Name    string \`json:"name"\`
	Address \*struct {
		Street string \`json:"street"\`
		City   string \`json:"city"\`
	} \`json:"address"\`
}

var person = (\*Person)(data)  // ignoring tags, the underlying types are identical

Specific rules apply to (non-constant) conversions between numeric types or to and from a string type. These conversions may change the representation of `x` and incur a run-time cost. All other conversions only change the type but not the representation of `x`.

There is no linguistic mechanism to convert between pointers and integers. The package [`unsafe`](#Package_unsafe) implements this functionality under restricted circumstances.

#### Conversions between numeric types

For the conversion of non-constant numeric values, the following rules apply:

1.  When converting between [integer types](#Numeric_types), if the value is a signed integer, it is sign extended to implicit infinite precision; otherwise it is zero extended. It is then truncated to fit in the result type's size. For example, if `v := uint16(0x10F0)`, then `uint32(int8(v)) == 0xFFFFFFF0`. The conversion always yields a valid value; there is no indication of overflow.
2.  When converting a [floating-point number](#Numeric_types) to an integer, the fraction is discarded (truncation towards zero).
3.  When converting an integer or floating-point number to a floating-point type, or a [complex number](#Numeric_types) to another complex type, the result value is rounded to the precision specified by the destination type. For instance, the value of a variable `x` of type `float32` may be stored using additional precision beyond that of an IEEE-754 32-bit number, but float32(x) represents the result of rounding `x`'s value to 32-bit precision. Similarly, `x + 0.1` may use more than 32 bits of precision, but `float32(x + 0.1)` does not.

In all non-constant conversions involving floating-point or complex values, if the result type cannot represent the value the conversion succeeds but the result value is implementation-dependent.

#### Conversions to and from a string type

1.  Converting a signed or unsigned integer value to a string type yields a string containing the UTF-8 representation of the integer. Values outside the range of valid Unicode code points are converted to `"\uFFFD"`.
    
    string('a')       // "a"
    string(-1)        // "\\ufffd" == "\\xef\\xbf\\xbd"
    string(0xf8)      // "\\u00f8" == "ø" == "\\xc3\\xb8"
    type MyString string
    MyString(0x65e5)  // "\\u65e5" == "日" == "\\xe6\\x97\\xa5"
    
2.  Converting a slice of bytes to a string type yields a string whose successive bytes are the elements of the slice.
    
    string(\[\]byte{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', '\\xc3', '\\xb8'})   // "hellø"
    string(\[\]byte{})                                     // ""
    string(\[\]byte(nil))                                  // ""
    
    type MyBytes \[\]byte
    string(MyBytes{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', '\\xc3', '\\xb8'})  // "hellø"
    
3.  Converting a slice of runes to a string type yields a string that is the concatenation of the individual rune values converted to strings.
    
    string(\[\]rune{0x767d, 0x9d6c, 0x7fd4})   // "\\u767d\\u9d6c\\u7fd4" == "白鵬翔"
    string(\[\]rune{})                         // ""
    string(\[\]rune(nil))                      // ""
    
    type MyRunes \[\]rune
    string(MyRunes{0x767d, 0x9d6c, 0x7fd4})  // "\\u767d\\u9d6c\\u7fd4" == "白鵬翔"
    
4.  Converting a value of a string type to a slice of bytes type yields a slice whose successive elements are the bytes of the string.
    
    \[\]byte("hellø")   // \[\]byte{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', '\\xc3', '\\xb8'}
    \[\]byte("")        // \[\]byte{}
    
    MyBytes("hellø")  // \[\]byte{'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', '\\xc3', '\\xb8'}
    
5.  Converting a value of a string type to a slice of runes type yields a slice containing the individual Unicode code points of the string.
    
    \[\]rune(MyString("白鵬翔"))  // \[\]rune{0x767d, 0x9d6c, 0x7fd4}
    \[\]rune("")                 // \[\]rune{}
    
    MyRunes("白鵬翔")           // \[\]rune{0x767d, 0x9d6c, 0x7fd4}
    

#### Conversions from slice to array pointer

Converting a slice to an array pointer yields a pointer to the underlying array of the slice. If the [length](#Length_and_capacity) of the slice is less than the length of the array, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs.

s := make(\[\]byte, 2, 4)
s0 := (\*\[0\]byte)(s)      // s0 != nil
s1 := (\*\[1\]byte)(s\[1:\])  // &s1\[0\] == &s\[1\]
s2 := (\*\[2\]byte)(s)      // &s2\[0\] == &s\[0\]
s4 := (\*\[4\]byte)(s)      // panics: len(\[4\]byte) > len(s)

var t \[\]string
t0 := (\*\[0\]string)(t)    // t0 == nil
t1 := (\*\[1\]string)(t)    // panics: len(\[1\]string) > len(t)

u := make(\[\]byte, 0)
u0 := (\*\[0\]byte)(u)      // u0 != nil

### Constant expressions

Constant expressions may contain only [constant](#Constants) operands and are evaluated at compile time.

Untyped boolean, numeric, and string constants may be used as operands wherever it is legal to use an operand of boolean, numeric, or string type, respectively.

A constant [comparison](#Comparison_operators) always yields an untyped boolean constant. If the left operand of a constant [shift expression](#Operators) is an untyped constant, the result is an integer constant; otherwise it is a constant of the same type as the left operand, which must be of [integer type](#Numeric_types).

Any other operation on untyped constants results in an untyped constant of the same kind; that is, a boolean, integer, floating-point, complex, or string constant. If the untyped operands of a binary operation (other than a shift) are of different kinds, the result is of the operand's kind that appears later in this list: integer, rune, floating-point, complex. For example, an untyped integer constant divided by an untyped complex constant yields an untyped complex constant.

const a = 2 + 3.0          // a == 5.0   (untyped floating-point constant)
const b = 15 / 4           // b == 3     (untyped integer constant)
const c = 15 / 4.0         // c == 3.75  (untyped floating-point constant)
const Θ float64 = 3/2      // Θ == 1.0   (type float64, 3/2 is integer division)
const Π float64 = 3/2.     // Π == 1.5   (type float64, 3/2. is float division)
const d = 1 << 3.0         // d == 8     (untyped integer constant)
const e = 1.0 << 3         // e == 8     (untyped integer constant)
const f = int32(1) << 33   // illegal    (constant 8589934592 overflows int32)
const g = float64(2) >> 1  // illegal    (float64(2) is a typed floating-point constant)
const h = "foo" > "bar"    // h == true  (untyped boolean constant)
const j = true             // j == true  (untyped boolean constant)
const k = 'w' + 1          // k == 'x'   (untyped rune constant)
const l = "hi"             // l == "hi"  (untyped string constant)
const m = string(k)        // m == "x"   (type string)
const Σ = 1 - 0.707i       //            (untyped complex constant)
const Δ = Σ + 2.0e-4       //            (untyped complex constant)
const Φ = iota\*1i - 1/1i   //            (untyped complex constant)

Applying the built-in function `complex` to untyped integer, rune, or floating-point constants yields an untyped complex constant.

const ic = complex(0, c)   // ic == 3.75i  (untyped complex constant)
const iΘ = complex(0, Θ)   // iΘ == 1i     (type complex128)

Constant expressions are always evaluated exactly; intermediate values and the constants themselves may require precision significantly larger than supported by any predeclared type in the language. The following are legal declarations:

const Huge = 1 << 100         // Huge == 1267650600228229401496703205376  (untyped integer constant)
const Four int8 = Huge >> 98  // Four == 4                                (type int8)

The divisor of a constant division or remainder operation must not be zero:

3.14 / 0.0   // illegal: division by zero

The values of _typed_ constants must always be accurately [representable](#Representability) by values of the constant type. The following constant expressions are illegal:

uint(-1)     // -1 cannot be represented as a uint
int(3.14)    // 3.14 cannot be represented as an int
int64(Huge)  // 1267650600228229401496703205376 cannot be represented as an int64
Four \* 300   // operand 300 cannot be represented as an int8 (type of Four)
Four \* 100   // product 400 cannot be represented as an int8 (type of Four)

The mask used by the unary bitwise complement operator `^` matches the rule for non-constants: the mask is all 1s for unsigned constants and -1 for signed and untyped constants.

^1         // untyped integer constant, equal to -2
uint8(^1)  // illegal: same as uint8(-2), -2 cannot be represented as a uint8
^uint8(1)  // typed uint8 constant, same as 0xFF ^ uint8(1) = uint8(0xFE)
int8(^1)   // same as int8(-2)
^int8(1)   // same as -1 ^ int8(1) = -2

Implementation restriction: A compiler may use rounding while computing untyped floating-point or complex constant expressions; see the implementation restriction in the section on [constants](#Constants). This rounding may cause a floating-point constant expression to be invalid in an integer context, even if it would be integral when calculated using infinite precision, and vice versa.

### Order of evaluation

At package level, [initialization dependencies](#Package_initialization) determine the evaluation order of individual initialization expressions in [variable declarations](#Variable_declarations). Otherwise, when evaluating the [operands](#Operands) of an expression, assignment, or [return statement](#Return_statements), all function calls, method calls, and communication operations are evaluated in lexical left-to-right order.

For example, in the (function-local) assignment

y\[f()\], ok = g(h(), i()+x\[j()\], <-c), k()

the function calls and communication happen in the order `f()`, `h()`, `i()`, `j()`, `<-c`, `g()`, and `k()`. However, the order of those events compared to the evaluation and indexing of `x` and the evaluation of `y` is not specified.

a := 1
f := func() int { a++; return a }
x := \[\]int{a, f()}            // x may be \[1, 2\] or \[2, 2\]: evaluation order between a and f() is not specified
m := map\[int\]int{a: 1, a: 2}  // m may be {2: 1} or {2: 2}: evaluation order between the two map assignments is not specified
n := map\[int\]int{a: f()}      // n may be {2: 3} or {3: 3}: evaluation order between the key and the value is not specified

At package level, initialization dependencies override the left-to-right rule for individual initialization expressions, but not for operands within each expression:

var a, b, c = f() + v(), g(), sqr(u()) + v()

func f() int        { return c }
func g() int        { return a }
func sqr(x int) int { return x\*x }

// functions u and v are independent of all other variables and functions

The function calls happen in the order `u()`, `sqr()`, `v()`, `f()`, `v()`, and `g()`.

Floating-point operations within a single expression are evaluated according to the associativity of the operators. Explicit parentheses affect the evaluation by overriding the default associativity. In the expression `x + (y + z)` the addition `y + z` is performed before adding `x`.

Statements
----------

Statements control execution.

Statement =
	[Declaration](#Declaration) | [LabeledStmt](#LabeledStmt) | [SimpleStmt](#SimpleStmt) |
	[GoStmt](#GoStmt) | [ReturnStmt](#ReturnStmt) | [BreakStmt](#BreakStmt) | [ContinueStmt](#ContinueStmt) | [GotoStmt](#GotoStmt) |
	[FallthroughStmt](#FallthroughStmt) | [Block](#Block) | [IfStmt](#IfStmt) | [SwitchStmt](#SwitchStmt) | [SelectStmt](#SelectStmt) | [ForStmt](#ForStmt) |
	[DeferStmt](#DeferStmt) .

SimpleStmt = [EmptyStmt](#EmptyStmt) | [ExpressionStmt](#ExpressionStmt) | [SendStmt](#SendStmt) | [IncDecStmt](#IncDecStmt) | [Assignment](#Assignment) | [ShortVarDecl](#ShortVarDecl) .

### Terminating statements

A _terminating statement_ interrupts the regular flow of control in a [block](#Blocks). The following statements are terminating:

1.  A ["return"](#Return_statements) or ["goto"](#Goto_statements) statement.
    
2.  A call to the built-in function [`panic`](#Handling_panics).
    
3.  A [block](#Blocks) in which the statement list ends in a terminating statement.
    
4.  An ["if" statement](#If_statements) in which:
    *   the "else" branch is present, and
    *   both branches are terminating statements.
5.  A ["for" statement](#For_statements) in which:
    *   there are no "break" statements referring to the "for" statement, and
    *   the loop condition is absent, and
    *   the "for" statement does not use a range clause.
6.  A ["switch" statement](#Switch_statements) in which:
    *   there are no "break" statements referring to the "switch" statement,
    *   there is a default case, and
    *   the statement lists in each case, including the default, end in a terminating statement, or a possibly labeled ["fallthrough" statement](#Fallthrough_statements).
7.  A ["select" statement](#Select_statements) in which:
    *   there are no "break" statements referring to the "select" statement, and
    *   the statement lists in each case, including the default if present, end in a terminating statement.
8.  A [labeled statement](#Labeled_statements) labeling a terminating statement.

All other statements are not terminating.

A [statement list](#Blocks) ends in a terminating statement if the list is not empty and its final non-empty statement is terminating.

### Empty statements

The empty statement does nothing.

EmptyStmt = .

### Labeled statements

A labeled statement may be the target of a `goto`, `break` or `continue` statement.

LabeledStmt = [Label](#Label) ":" [Statement](#Statement) .
Label       = [identifier](#identifier) .

Error: log.Panic("error encountered")

### Expression statements

With the exception of specific built-in functions, function and method [calls](#Calls) and [receive operations](#Receive_operator) can appear in statement context. Such statements may be parenthesized.

ExpressionStmt = [Expression](#Expression) .

The following built-in functions are not permitted in statement context:

append cap complex imag len make new real
unsafe.Add unsafe.Alignof unsafe.Offsetof unsafe.Sizeof unsafe.Slice

h(x+y)
f.Close()
<-ch
(<-ch)
len("foo")  // illegal if len is the built-in function

### Send statements

A send statement sends a value on a channel. The channel expression's [core type](#Core_types) must be a [channel](#Channel_types), the channel direction must permit send operations, and the type of the value to be sent must be [assignable](#Assignability) to the channel's element type.

SendStmt = [Channel](#Channel) "<-" [Expression](#Expression) .
Channel  = [Expression](#Expression) .

Both the channel and the value expression are evaluated before communication begins. Communication blocks until the send can proceed. A send on an unbuffered channel can proceed if a receiver is ready. A send on a buffered channel can proceed if there is room in the buffer. A send on a closed channel proceeds by causing a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics). A send on a `nil` channel blocks forever.

ch <- 3  // send value 3 to channel ch

### IncDec statements

The "++" and "--" statements increment or decrement their operands by the untyped [constant](#Constants) `1`. As with an assignment, the operand must be [addressable](#Address_operators) or a map index expression.

IncDecStmt = [Expression](#Expression) ( "++" | "--" ) .

The following [assignment statements](#Assignments) are semantically equivalent:

IncDec statement    Assignment
x++                 x += 1
x--                 x -= 1

### Assignments

Assignment = [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) [assign\_op](#assign_op) [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) .

assign\_op = \[ [add\_op](#add_op) | [mul\_op](#mul_op) \] "=" .

Each left-hand side operand must be [addressable](#Address_operators), a map index expression, or (for `=` assignments only) the [blank identifier](#Blank_identifier). Operands may be parenthesized.

x = 1
\*p = f()
a\[i\] = 23
(k) = <-ch  // same as: k = <-ch

An _assignment operation_ `x` _op_`=` `y` where _op_ is a binary [arithmetic operator](#Arithmetic_operators) is equivalent to `x` `=` `x` _op_ `(y)` but evaluates `x` only once. The _op_`=` construct is a single token. In assignment operations, both the left- and right-hand expression lists must contain exactly one single-valued expression, and the left-hand expression must not be the blank identifier.

a\[i\] <<= 2
i &^= 1<<n

A tuple assignment assigns the individual elements of a multi-valued operation to a list of variables. There are two forms. In the first, the right hand operand is a single multi-valued expression such as a function call, a [channel](#Channel_types) or [map](#Map_types) operation, or a [type assertion](#Type_assertions). The number of operands on the left hand side must match the number of values. For instance, if `f` is a function returning two values,

x, y = f()

assigns the first value to `x` and the second to `y`. In the second form, the number of operands on the left must equal the number of expressions on the right, each of which must be single-valued, and the _n_th expression on the right is assigned to the _n_th operand on the left:

one, two, three = '一', '二', '三'

The [blank identifier](#Blank_identifier) provides a way to ignore right-hand side values in an assignment:

\_ = x       // evaluate x but ignore it
x, \_ = f()  // evaluate f() but ignore second result value

The assignment proceeds in two phases. First, the operands of [index expressions](#Index_expressions) and [pointer indirections](#Address_operators) (including implicit pointer indirections in [selectors](#Selectors)) on the left and the expressions on the right are all [evaluated in the usual order](#Order_of_evaluation). Second, the assignments are carried out in left-to-right order.

a, b = b, a  // exchange a and b

x := \[\]int{1, 2, 3}
i := 0
i, x\[i\] = 1, 2  // set i = 1, x\[0\] = 2

i = 0
x\[i\], i = 2, 1  // set x\[0\] = 2, i = 1

x\[0\], x\[0\] = 1, 2  // set x\[0\] = 1, then x\[0\] = 2 (so x\[0\] == 2 at end)

x\[1\], x\[3\] = 4, 5  // set x\[1\] = 4, then panic setting x\[3\] = 5.

type Point struct { x, y int }
var p \*Point
x\[2\], p.x = 6, 7  // set x\[2\] = 6, then panic setting p.x = 7

i = 2
x = \[\]int{3, 5, 7}
for i, x\[i\] = range x {  // set i, x\[2\] = 0, x\[0\]
	break
}
// after this loop, i == 0 and x == \[\]int{3, 5, 3}

In assignments, each value must be [assignable](#Assignability) to the type of the operand to which it is assigned, with the following special cases:

1.  Any typed value may be assigned to the blank identifier.
2.  If an untyped constant is assigned to a variable of interface type or the blank identifier, the constant is first implicitly [converted](#Conversions) to its [default type](#Constants).
3.  If an untyped boolean value is assigned to a variable of interface type or the blank identifier, it is first implicitly converted to type `bool`.

### If statements

"If" statements specify the conditional execution of two branches according to the value of a boolean expression. If the expression evaluates to true, the "if" branch is executed, otherwise, if present, the "else" branch is executed.

IfStmt = "if" \[ [SimpleStmt](#SimpleStmt) ";" \] [Expression](#Expression) [Block](#Block) \[ "else" ( [IfStmt](#IfStmt) | [Block](#Block) ) \] .

if x > max {
	x = max
}

The expression may be preceded by a simple statement, which executes before the expression is evaluated.

if x := f(); x < y {
	return x
} else if x > z {
	return z
} else {
	return y
}

### Switch statements

"Switch" statements provide multi-way execution. An expression or type is compared to the "cases" inside the "switch" to determine which branch to execute.

SwitchStmt = [ExprSwitchStmt](#ExprSwitchStmt) | [TypeSwitchStmt](#TypeSwitchStmt) .

There are two forms: expression switches and type switches. In an expression switch, the cases contain expressions that are compared against the value of the switch expression. In a type switch, the cases contain types that are compared against the type of a specially annotated switch expression. The switch expression is evaluated exactly once in a switch statement.

#### Expression switches

In an expression switch, the switch expression is evaluated and the case expressions, which need not be constants, are evaluated left-to-right and top-to-bottom; the first one that equals the switch expression triggers execution of the statements of the associated case; the other cases are skipped. If no case matches and there is a "default" case, its statements are executed. There can be at most one default case and it may appear anywhere in the "switch" statement. A missing switch expression is equivalent to the boolean value `true`.

ExprSwitchStmt = "switch" \[ [SimpleStmt](#SimpleStmt) ";" \] \[ [Expression](#Expression) \] "{" { [ExprCaseClause](#ExprCaseClause) } "}" .
ExprCaseClause = [ExprSwitchCase](#ExprSwitchCase) ":" [StatementList](#StatementList) .
ExprSwitchCase = "case" [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) | "default" .

If the switch expression evaluates to an untyped constant, it is first implicitly [converted](#Conversions) to its [default type](#Constants). The predeclared untyped value `nil` cannot be used as a switch expression. The switch expression type must be [comparable](#Comparison_operators).

If a case expression is untyped, it is first implicitly [converted](#Conversions) to the type of the switch expression. For each (possibly converted) case expression `x` and the value `t` of the switch expression, `x == t` must be a valid [comparison](#Comparison_operators).

In other words, the switch expression is treated as if it were used to declare and initialize a temporary variable `t` without explicit type; it is that value of `t` against which each case expression `x` is tested for equality.

In a case or default clause, the last non-empty statement may be a (possibly [labeled](#Labeled_statements)) ["fallthrough" statement](#Fallthrough_statements) to indicate that control should flow from the end of this clause to the first statement of the next clause. Otherwise control flows to the end of the "switch" statement. A "fallthrough" statement may appear as the last statement of all but the last clause of an expression switch.

The switch expression may be preceded by a simple statement, which executes before the expression is evaluated.

switch tag {
default: s3()
case 0, 1, 2, 3: s1()
case 4, 5, 6, 7: s2()
}

switch x := f(); {  // missing switch expression means "true"
case x < 0: return -x
default: return x
}

switch {
case x < y: f1()
case x < z: f2()
case x == 4: f3()
}

Implementation restriction: A compiler may disallow multiple case expressions evaluating to the same constant. For instance, the current compilers disallow duplicate integer, floating point, or string constants in case expressions.

#### Type switches

A type switch compares types rather than values. It is otherwise similar to an expression switch. It is marked by a special switch expression that has the form of a [type assertion](#Type_assertions) using the keyword `type` rather than an actual type:

switch x.(type) {
// cases
}

Cases then match actual types `T` against the dynamic type of the expression `x`. As with type assertions, `x` must be of [interface type](#Interface_types), but not a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), and each non-interface type `T` listed in a case must implement the type of `x`. The types listed in the cases of a type switch must all be [different](#Type_identity).

TypeSwitchStmt  = "switch" \[ [SimpleStmt](#SimpleStmt) ";" \] [TypeSwitchGuard](#TypeSwitchGuard) "{" { [TypeCaseClause](#TypeCaseClause) } "}" .
TypeSwitchGuard = \[ [identifier](#identifier) ":=" \] [PrimaryExpr](#PrimaryExpr) "." "(" "type" ")" .
TypeCaseClause  = [TypeSwitchCase](#TypeSwitchCase) ":" [StatementList](#StatementList) .
TypeSwitchCase  = "case" [TypeList](#TypeList) | "default" .

The TypeSwitchGuard may include a [short variable declaration](#Short_variable_declarations). When that form is used, the variable is declared at the end of the TypeSwitchCase in the [implicit block](#Blocks) of each clause. In clauses with a case listing exactly one type, the variable has that type; otherwise, the variable has the type of the expression in the TypeSwitchGuard.

Instead of a type, a case may use the predeclared identifier [`nil`](#Predeclared_identifiers); that case is selected when the expression in the TypeSwitchGuard is a `nil` interface value. There may be at most one `nil` case.

Given an expression `x` of type `interface{}`, the following type switch:

switch i := x.(type) {
case nil:
	printString("x is nil")                // type of i is type of x (interface{})
case int:
	printInt(i)                            // type of i is int
case float64:
	printFloat64(i)                        // type of i is float64
case func(int) float64:
	printFunction(i)                       // type of i is func(int) float64
case bool, string:
	printString("type is bool or string")  // type of i is type of x (interface{})
default:
	printString("don't know the type")     // type of i is type of x (interface{})
}

could be rewritten:

v := x  // x is evaluated exactly once
if v == nil {
	i := v                                 // type of i is type of x (interface{})
	printString("x is nil")
} else if i, isInt := v.(int); isInt {
	printInt(i)                            // type of i is int
} else if i, isFloat64 := v.(float64); isFloat64 {
	printFloat64(i)                        // type of i is float64
} else if i, isFunc := v.(func(int) float64); isFunc {
	printFunction(i)                       // type of i is func(int) float64
} else {
	\_, isBool := v.(bool)
	\_, isString := v.(string)
	if isBool || isString {
		i := v                         // type of i is type of x (interface{})
		printString("type is bool or string")
	} else {
		i := v                         // type of i is type of x (interface{})
		printString("don't know the type")
	}
}

A [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations) or a [generic type](#Type_declarations) may be used as a type in a case. If upon [instantiation](#Instantiations) that type turns out to duplicate another entry in the switch, the first matching case is chosen.

func f\[P any\](x any) int {
	switch x.(type) {
	case P:
		return 0
	case string:
		return 1
	case \[\]P:
		return 2
	case \[\]byte:
		return 3
	default:
		return 4
	}
}

var v1 = f\[string\]("foo")   // v1 == 0
var v2 = f\[byte\](\[\]byte{})  // v2 == 2

The type switch guard may be preceded by a simple statement, which executes before the guard is evaluated.

The "fallthrough" statement is not permitted in a type switch.

### For statements

A "for" statement specifies repeated execution of a block. There are three forms: The iteration may be controlled by a single condition, a "for" clause, or a "range" clause.

ForStmt = "for" \[ [Condition](#Condition) | [ForClause](#ForClause) | [RangeClause](#RangeClause) \] [Block](#Block) .
Condition = [Expression](#Expression) .

#### For statements with single condition

In its simplest form, a "for" statement specifies the repeated execution of a block as long as a boolean condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is absent, it is equivalent to the boolean value `true`.

for a < b {
	a \*= 2
}

#### For statements with `for` clause

A "for" statement with a ForClause is also controlled by its condition, but additionally it may specify an _init_ and a _post_ statement, such as an assignment, an increment or decrement statement. The init statement may be a [short variable declaration](#Short_variable_declarations), but the post statement must not. Variables declared by the init statement are re-used in each iteration.

ForClause = \[ [InitStmt](#InitStmt) \] ";" \[ [Condition](#Condition) \] ";" \[ [PostStmt](#PostStmt) \] .
InitStmt = [SimpleStmt](#SimpleStmt) .
PostStmt = [SimpleStmt](#SimpleStmt) .

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
	f(i)
}

If non-empty, the init statement is executed once before evaluating the condition for the first iteration; the post statement is executed after each execution of the block (and only if the block was executed). Any element of the ForClause may be empty but the [semicolons](#Semicolons) are required unless there is only a condition. If the condition is absent, it is equivalent to the boolean value `true`.

for cond { S() }    is the same as    for ; cond ; { S() }
for      { S() }    is the same as    for true     { S() }

#### For statements with `range` clause

A "for" statement with a "range" clause iterates through all entries of an array, slice, string or map, or values received on a channel. For each entry it assigns _iteration values_ to corresponding _iteration variables_ if present and then executes the block.

RangeClause = \[ [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) "=" | [IdentifierList](#IdentifierList) ":=" \] "range" [Expression](#Expression) .

The expression on the right in the "range" clause is called the _range expression_, its [core type](#Core_types) must be an array, pointer to an array, slice, string, map, or channel permitting [receive operations](#Receive_operator). As with an assignment, if present the operands on the left must be [addressable](#Address_operators) or map index expressions; they denote the iteration variables. If the range expression is a channel, at most one iteration variable is permitted, otherwise there may be up to two. If the last iteration variable is the [blank identifier](#Blank_identifier), the range clause is equivalent to the same clause without that identifier.

The range expression `x` is evaluated once before beginning the loop, with one exception: if at most one iteration variable is present and `len(x)` is [constant](#Length_and_capacity), the range expression is not evaluated.

Function calls on the left are evaluated once per iteration. For each iteration, iteration values are produced as follows if the respective iteration variables are present:

Range expression                          1st value          2nd value

array or slice  a  \[n\]E, \*\[n\]E, or \[\]E    index    i  int    a\[i\]       E
string          s  string type            index    i  int    see below  rune
map             m  map\[K\]V                key      k  K      m\[k\]       V
channel         c  chan E, <-chan E       element  e  E

1.  For an array, pointer to array, or slice value `a`, the index iteration values are produced in increasing order, starting at element index 0. If at most one iteration variable is present, the range loop produces iteration values from 0 up to `len(a)-1` and does not index into the array or slice itself. For a `nil` slice, the number of iterations is 0.
2.  For a string value, the "range" clause iterates over the Unicode code points in the string starting at byte index 0. On successive iterations, the index value will be the index of the first byte of successive UTF-8-encoded code points in the string, and the second value, of type `rune`, will be the value of the corresponding code point. If the iteration encounters an invalid UTF-8 sequence, the second value will be `0xFFFD`, the Unicode replacement character, and the next iteration will advance a single byte in the string.
3.  The iteration order over maps is not specified and is not guaranteed to be the same from one iteration to the next. If a map entry that has not yet been reached is removed during iteration, the corresponding iteration value will not be produced. If a map entry is created during iteration, that entry may be produced during the iteration or may be skipped. The choice may vary for each entry created and from one iteration to the next. If the map is `nil`, the number of iterations is 0.
4.  For channels, the iteration values produced are the successive values sent on the channel until the channel is [closed](#Close). If the channel is `nil`, the range expression blocks forever.

The iteration values are assigned to the respective iteration variables as in an [assignment statement](#Assignments).

The iteration variables may be declared by the "range" clause using a form of [short variable declaration](#Short_variable_declarations) (`:=`). In this case their types are set to the types of the respective iteration values and their [scope](#Declarations_and_scope) is the block of the "for" statement; they are re-used in each iteration. If the iteration variables are declared outside the "for" statement, after execution their values will be those of the last iteration.

var testdata \*struct {
	a \*\[7\]int
}
for i, \_ := range testdata.a {
	// testdata.a is never evaluated; len(testdata.a) is constant
	// i ranges from 0 to 6
	f(i)
}

var a \[10\]string
for i, s := range a {
	// type of i is int
	// type of s is string
	// s == a\[i\]
	g(i, s)
}

var key string
var val interface{}  // element type of m is assignable to val
m := map\[string\]int{"mon":0, "tue":1, "wed":2, "thu":3, "fri":4, "sat":5, "sun":6}
for key, val = range m {
	h(key, val)
}
// key == last map key encountered in iteration
// val == map\[key\]

var ch chan Work = producer()
for w := range ch {
	doWork(w)
}

// empty a channel
for range ch {}

### Go statements

A "go" statement starts the execution of a function call as an independent concurrent thread of control, or _goroutine_, within the same address space.

GoStmt = "go" [Expression](#Expression) .

The expression must be a function or method call; it cannot be parenthesized. Calls of built-in functions are restricted as for [expression statements](#Expression_statements).

The function value and parameters are [evaluated as usual](#Calls) in the calling goroutine, but unlike with a regular call, program execution does not wait for the invoked function to complete. Instead, the function begins executing independently in a new goroutine. When the function terminates, its goroutine also terminates. If the function has any return values, they are discarded when the function completes.

go Server()
go func(ch chan<- bool) { for { sleep(10); ch <- true }} (c)

### Select statements

A "select" statement chooses which of a set of possible [send](#Send_statements) or [receive](#Receive_operator) operations will proceed. It looks similar to a ["switch"](#Switch_statements) statement but with the cases all referring to communication operations.

SelectStmt = "select" "{" { [CommClause](#CommClause) } "}" .
CommClause = [CommCase](#CommCase) ":" [StatementList](#StatementList) .
CommCase   = "case" ( [SendStmt](#SendStmt) | [RecvStmt](#RecvStmt) ) | "default" .
RecvStmt   = \[ [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) "=" | [IdentifierList](#IdentifierList) ":=" \] [RecvExpr](#RecvExpr) .
RecvExpr   = [Expression](#Expression) .

A case with a RecvStmt may assign the result of a RecvExpr to one or two variables, which may be declared using a [short variable declaration](#Short_variable_declarations). The RecvExpr must be a (possibly parenthesized) receive operation. There can be at most one default case and it may appear anywhere in the list of cases.

Execution of a "select" statement proceeds in several steps:

1.  For all the cases in the statement, the channel operands of receive operations and the channel and right-hand-side expressions of send statements are evaluated exactly once, in source order, upon entering the "select" statement. The result is a set of channels to receive from or send to, and the corresponding values to send. Any side effects in that evaluation will occur irrespective of which (if any) communication operation is selected to proceed. Expressions on the left-hand side of a RecvStmt with a short variable declaration or assignment are not yet evaluated.
2.  If one or more of the communications can proceed, a single one that can proceed is chosen via a uniform pseudo-random selection. Otherwise, if there is a default case, that case is chosen. If there is no default case, the "select" statement blocks until at least one of the communications can proceed.
3.  Unless the selected case is the default case, the respective communication operation is executed.
4.  If the selected case is a RecvStmt with a short variable declaration or an assignment, the left-hand side expressions are evaluated and the received value (or values) are assigned.
5.  The statement list of the selected case is executed.

Since communication on `nil` channels can never proceed, a select with only `nil` channels and no default case blocks forever.

var a \[\]int
var c, c1, c2, c3, c4 chan int
var i1, i2 int
select {
case i1 = <-c1:
	print("received ", i1, " from c1\\n")
case c2 <- i2:
	print("sent ", i2, " to c2\\n")
case i3, ok := (<-c3):  // same as: i3, ok := <-c3
	if ok {
		print("received ", i3, " from c3\\n")
	} else {
		print("c3 is closed\\n")
	}
case a\[f()\] = <-c4:
	// same as:
	// case t := <-c4
	//	a\[f()\] = t
default:
	print("no communication\\n")
}

for {  // send random sequence of bits to c
	select {
	case c <- 0:  // note: no statement, no fallthrough, no folding of cases
	case c <- 1:
	}
}

select {}  // block forever

### Return statements

A "return" statement in a function `F` terminates the execution of `F`, and optionally provides one or more result values. Any functions [deferred](#Defer_statements) by `F` are executed before `F` returns to its caller.

ReturnStmt = "return" \[ [ExpressionList](#ExpressionList) \] .

In a function without a result type, a "return" statement must not specify any result values.

func noResult() {
	return
}

There are three ways to return values from a function with a result type:

1.  The return value or values may be explicitly listed in the "return" statement. Each expression must be single-valued and [assignable](#Assignability) to the corresponding element of the function's result type.
    
    func simpleF() int {
    	return 2
    }
    
    func complexF1() (re float64, im float64) {
    	return -7.0, -4.0
    }
    
2.  The expression list in the "return" statement may be a single call to a multi-valued function. The effect is as if each value returned from that function were assigned to a temporary variable with the type of the respective value, followed by a "return" statement listing these variables, at which point the rules of the previous case apply.
    
    func complexF2() (re float64, im float64) {
    	return complexF1()
    }
    
3.  The expression list may be empty if the function's result type specifies names for its [result parameters](#Function_types). The result parameters act as ordinary local variables and the function may assign values to them as necessary. The "return" statement returns the values of these variables.
    
    func complexF3() (re float64, im float64) {
    	re = 7.0
    	im = 4.0
    	return
    }
    
    func (devnull) Write(p \[\]byte) (n int, \_ error) {
    	n = len(p)
    	return
    }
    

Regardless of how they are declared, all the result values are initialized to the [zero values](#The_zero_value) for their type upon entry to the function. A "return" statement that specifies results sets the result parameters before any deferred functions are executed.

Implementation restriction: A compiler may disallow an empty expression list in a "return" statement if a different entity (constant, type, or variable) with the same name as a result parameter is in [scope](#Declarations_and_scope) at the place of the return.

func f(n int) (res int, err error) {
	if \_, err := f(n-1); err != nil {
		return  // invalid return statement: err is shadowed
	}
	return
}

### Break statements

A "break" statement terminates execution of the innermost ["for"](#For_statements), ["switch"](#Switch_statements), or ["select"](#Select_statements) statement within the same function.

BreakStmt = "break" \[ [Label](#Label) \] .

If there is a label, it must be that of an enclosing "for", "switch", or "select" statement, and that is the one whose execution terminates.

OuterLoop:
	for i = 0; i < n; i++ {
		for j = 0; j < m; j++ {
			switch a\[i\]\[j\] {
			case nil:
				state = Error
				break OuterLoop
			case item:
				state = Found
				break OuterLoop
			}
		}
	}

### Continue statements

A "continue" statement begins the next iteration of the innermost ["for" loop](#For_statements) at its post statement. The "for" loop must be within the same function.

ContinueStmt = "continue" \[ [Label](#Label) \] .

If there is a label, it must be that of an enclosing "for" statement, and that is the one whose execution advances.

RowLoop:
	for y, row := range rows {
		for x, data := range row {
			if data == endOfRow {
				continue RowLoop
			}
			row\[x\] = data + bias(x, y)
		}
	}

### Goto statements

A "goto" statement transfers control to the statement with the corresponding label within the same function.

GotoStmt = "goto" [Label](#Label) .

goto Error

Executing the "goto" statement must not cause any variables to come into [scope](#Declarations_and_scope) that were not already in scope at the point of the goto. For instance, this example:

	goto L  // BAD
	v := 3
L:

is erroneous because the jump to label `L` skips the creation of `v`.

A "goto" statement outside a [block](#Blocks) cannot jump to a label inside that block. For instance, this example:

if n%2 == 1 {
	goto L1
}
for n > 0 {
	f()
	n--
L1:
	f()
	n--
}

is erroneous because the label `L1` is inside the "for" statement's block but the `goto` is not.

### Fallthrough statements

A "fallthrough" statement transfers control to the first statement of the next case clause in an [expression "switch" statement](#Expression_switches). It may be used only as the final non-empty statement in such a clause.

FallthroughStmt = "fallthrough" .

### Defer statements

A "defer" statement invokes a function whose execution is deferred to the moment the surrounding function returns, either because the surrounding function executed a [return statement](#Return_statements), reached the end of its [function body](#Function_declarations), or because the corresponding goroutine is [panicking](#Handling_panics).

DeferStmt = "defer" [Expression](#Expression) .

The expression must be a function or method call; it cannot be parenthesized. Calls of built-in functions are restricted as for [expression statements](#Expression_statements).

Each time a "defer" statement executes, the function value and parameters to the call are [evaluated as usual](#Calls) and saved anew but the actual function is not invoked. Instead, deferred functions are invoked immediately before the surrounding function returns, in the reverse order they were deferred. That is, if the surrounding function returns through an explicit [return statement](#Return_statements), deferred functions are executed _after_ any result parameters are set by that return statement but _before_ the function returns to its caller. If a deferred function value evaluates to `nil`, execution [panics](#Handling_panics) when the function is invoked, not when the "defer" statement is executed.

For instance, if the deferred function is a [function literal](#Function_literals) and the surrounding function has [named result parameters](#Function_types) that are in scope within the literal, the deferred function may access and modify the result parameters before they are returned. If the deferred function has any return values, they are discarded when the function completes. (See also the section on [handling panics](#Handling_panics).)

lock(l)
defer unlock(l)  // unlocking happens before surrounding function returns

// prints 3 2 1 0 before surrounding function returns
for i := 0; i <= 3; i++ {
	defer fmt.Print(i)
}

// f returns 42
func f() (result int) {
	defer func() {
		// result is accessed after it was set to 6 by the return statement
		result \*= 7
	}()
	return 6
}

Built-in functions
------------------

Built-in functions are [predeclared](#Predeclared_identifiers). They are called like any other function but some of them accept a type instead of an expression as the first argument.

The built-in functions do not have standard Go types, so they can only appear in [call expressions](#Calls); they cannot be used as function values.

### Close

For an argument `ch` with a [core type](#Core_types) that is a [channel](#Channel_types), the built-in function `close` records that no more values will be sent on the channel. It is an error if `ch` is a receive-only channel. Sending to or closing a closed channel causes a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics). Closing the nil channel also causes a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics). After calling `close`, and after any previously sent values have been received, receive operations will return the zero value for the channel's type without blocking. The multi-valued [receive operation](#Receive_operator) returns a received value along with an indication of whether the channel is closed.

### Length and capacity

The built-in functions `len` and `cap` take arguments of various types and return a result of type `int`. The implementation guarantees that the result always fits into an `int`.

Call      Argument type    Result

len(s)    string type      string length in bytes
          \[n\]T, \*\[n\]T      array length (== n)
          \[\]T              slice length
          map\[K\]T          map length (number of defined keys)
          chan T           number of elements queued in channel buffer
          type parameter   see below

cap(s)    \[n\]T, \*\[n\]T      array length (== n)
          \[\]T              slice capacity
          chan T           channel buffer capacity
          type parameter   see below

If the argument type is a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations) `P`, the call `len(e)` (or `cap(e)` respectively) must be valid for each type in `P`'s type set. The result is the length (or capacity, respectively) of the argument whose type corresponds to the type argument with which `P` was [instantiated](#Instantiations).

The capacity of a slice is the number of elements for which there is space allocated in the underlying array. At any time the following relationship holds:

0 <= len(s) <= cap(s)

The length of a `nil` slice, map or channel is 0. The capacity of a `nil` slice or channel is 0.

The expression `len(s)` is [constant](#Constants) if `s` is a string constant. The expressions `len(s)` and `cap(s)` are constants if the type of `s` is an array or pointer to an array and the expression `s` does not contain [channel receives](#Receive_operator) or (non-constant) [function calls](#Calls); in this case `s` is not evaluated. Otherwise, invocations of `len` and `cap` are not constant and `s` is evaluated.

const (
	c1 = imag(2i)                    // imag(2i) = 2.0 is a constant
	c2 = len(\[10\]float64{2})         // \[10\]float64{2} contains no function calls
	c3 = len(\[10\]float64{c1})        // \[10\]float64{c1} contains no function calls
	c4 = len(\[10\]float64{imag(2i)})  // imag(2i) is a constant and no function call is issued
	c5 = len(\[10\]float64{imag(z)})   // invalid: imag(z) is a (non-constant) function call
)
var z complex128

### Allocation

The built-in function `new` takes a type `T`, allocates storage for a [variable](#Variables) of that type at run time, and returns a value of type `*T` [pointing](#Pointer_types) to it. The variable is initialized as described in the section on [initial values](#The_zero_value).

new(T)

For instance

type S struct { a int; b float64 }
new(S)

allocates storage for a variable of type `S`, initializes it (`a=0`, `b=0.0`), and returns a value of type `*S` containing the address of the location.

### Making slices, maps and channels

The built-in function `make` takes a type `T`, optionally followed by a type-specific list of expressions. The [core type](#Core_types) of `T` must be a slice, map or channel. It returns a value of type `T` (not `*T`). The memory is initialized as described in the section on [initial values](#The_zero_value).

Call             Core type    Result

make(T, n)       slice        slice of type T with length n and capacity n
make(T, n, m)    slice        slice of type T with length n and capacity m

make(T)          map          map of type T
make(T, n)       map          map of type T with initial space for approximately n elements

make(T)          channel      unbuffered channel of type T
make(T, n)       channel      buffered channel of type T, buffer size n

Each of the size arguments `n` and `m` must be of [integer type](#Numeric_types), have a [type set](#Interface_types) containing only integer types, or be an untyped [constant](#Constants). A constant size argument must be non-negative and [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `int`; if it is an untyped constant it is given type `int`. If both `n` and `m` are provided and are constant, then `n` must be no larger than `m`. If `n` is negative or larger than `m` at run time, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs.

s := make(\[\]int, 10, 100)       // slice with len(s) == 10, cap(s) == 100
s := make(\[\]int, 1e3)           // slice with len(s) == cap(s) == 1000
s := make(\[\]int, 1<<63)         // illegal: len(s) is not representable by a value of type int
s := make(\[\]int, 10, 0)         // illegal: len(s) > cap(s)
c := make(chan int, 10)         // channel with a buffer size of 10
m := make(map\[string\]int, 100)  // map with initial space for approximately 100 elements

Calling `make` with a map type and size hint `n` will create a map with initial space to hold `n` map elements. The precise behavior is implementation-dependent.

### Appending to and copying slices

The built-in functions `append` and `copy` assist in common slice operations. For both functions, the result is independent of whether the memory referenced by the arguments overlaps.

The [variadic](#Function_types) function `append` appends zero or more values `x` to a slice `s` and returns the resulting slice of the same type as `s`. The [core type](#Core_types) of `s` must be a slice of type `[]E`. The values `x` are passed to a parameter of type `...E` and the respective [parameter passing rules](#Passing_arguments_to_..._parameters) apply. As a special case, if the core type of `s` is `[]byte`, `append` also accepts a second argument with core type `string` followed by `...`. This form appends the bytes of the string.

append(s S, x ...E) S  // core type of S is \[\]E

If the capacity of `s` is not large enough to fit the additional values, `append` allocates a new, sufficiently large underlying array that fits both the existing slice elements and the additional values. Otherwise, `append` re-uses the underlying array.

s0 := \[\]int{0, 0}
s1 := append(s0, 2)                // append a single element     s1 == \[\]int{0, 0, 2}
s2 := append(s1, 3, 5, 7)          // append multiple elements    s2 == \[\]int{0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
s3 := append(s2, s0...)            // append a slice              s3 == \[\]int{0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 0}
s4 := append(s3\[3:6\], s3\[2:\]...)   // append overlapping slice    s4 == \[\]int{3, 5, 7, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 0}

var t \[\]interface{}
t = append(t, 42, 3.1415, "foo")   //                             t == \[\]interface{}{42, 3.1415, "foo"}

var b \[\]byte
b = append(b, "bar"...)            // append string contents      b == \[\]byte{'b', 'a', 'r' }

The function `copy` copies slice elements from a source `src` to a destination `dst` and returns the number of elements copied. The [core types](#Core_types) of both arguments must be slices with [identical](#Type_identity) element type. The number of elements copied is the minimum of `len(src)` and `len(dst)`. As a special case, if the destination's core type is `[]byte`, `copy` also accepts a source argument with core type `string`. This form copies the bytes from the string into the byte slice.

copy(dst, src \[\]T) int
copy(dst \[\]byte, src string) int

Examples:

var a = \[...\]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
var s = make(\[\]int, 6)
var b = make(\[\]byte, 5)
n1 := copy(s, a\[0:\])            // n1 == 6, s == \[\]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
n2 := copy(s, s\[2:\])            // n2 == 4, s == \[\]int{2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5}
n3 := copy(b, "Hello, World!")  // n3 == 5, b == \[\]byte("Hello")

### Deletion of map elements

The built-in function `delete` removes the element with key `k` from a [map](#Map_types) `m`. The value `k` must be [assignable](#Assignability) to the key type of `m`.

delete(m, k)  // remove element m\[k\] from map m

If the type of `m` is a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), all types in that type set must be maps, and they must all have identical key types.

If the map `m` is `nil` or the element `m[k]` does not exist, `delete` is a no-op.

### Manipulating complex numbers

Three functions assemble and disassemble complex numbers. The built-in function `complex` constructs a complex value from a floating-point real and imaginary part, while `real` and `imag` extract the real and imaginary parts of a complex value.

complex(realPart, imaginaryPart floatT) complexT
real(complexT) floatT
imag(complexT) floatT

The type of the arguments and return value correspond. For `complex`, the two arguments must be of the same [floating-point type](#Numeric_types) and the return type is the [complex type](#Numeric_types) with the corresponding floating-point constituents: `complex64` for `float32` arguments, and `complex128` for `float64` arguments. If one of the arguments evaluates to an untyped constant, it is first implicitly [converted](#Conversions) to the type of the other argument. If both arguments evaluate to untyped constants, they must be non-complex numbers or their imaginary parts must be zero, and the return value of the function is an untyped complex constant.

For `real` and `imag`, the argument must be of complex type, and the return type is the corresponding floating-point type: `float32` for a `complex64` argument, and `float64` for a `complex128` argument. If the argument evaluates to an untyped constant, it must be a number, and the return value of the function is an untyped floating-point constant.

The `real` and `imag` functions together form the inverse of `complex`, so for a value `z` of a complex type `Z`, `z == Z(complex(real(z), imag(z)))`.

If the operands of these functions are all constants, the return value is a constant.

var a = complex(2, -2)             // complex128
const b = complex(1.0, -1.4)       // untyped complex constant 1 - 1.4i
x := float32(math.Cos(math.Pi/2))  // float32
var c64 = complex(5, -x)           // complex64
var s int = complex(1, 0)          // untyped complex constant 1 + 0i can be converted to int
\_ = complex(1, 2<<s)               // illegal: 2 assumes floating-point type, cannot shift
var rl = real(c64)                 // float32
var im = imag(a)                   // float64
const c = imag(b)                  // untyped constant -1.4
\_ = imag(3 << s)                   // illegal: 3 assumes complex type, cannot shift

Arguments of type parameter type are not permitted.

### Handling panics

Two built-in functions, `panic` and `recover`, assist in reporting and handling [run-time panics](#Run_time_panics) and program-defined error conditions.

func panic(interface{})
func recover() interface{}

While executing a function `F`, an explicit call to `panic` or a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) terminates the execution of `F`. Any functions [deferred](#Defer_statements) by `F` are then executed as usual. Next, any deferred functions run by `F`'s caller are run, and so on up to any deferred by the top-level function in the executing goroutine. At that point, the program is terminated and the error condition is reported, including the value of the argument to `panic`. This termination sequence is called _panicking_.

panic(42)
panic("unreachable")
panic(Error("cannot parse"))

The `recover` function allows a program to manage behavior of a panicking goroutine. Suppose a function `G` defers a function `D` that calls `recover` and a panic occurs in a function on the same goroutine in which `G` is executing. When the running of deferred functions reaches `D`, the return value of `D`'s call to `recover` will be the value passed to the call of `panic`. If `D` returns normally, without starting a new `panic`, the panicking sequence stops. In that case, the state of functions called between `G` and the call to `panic` is discarded, and normal execution resumes. Any functions deferred by `G` before `D` are then run and `G`'s execution terminates by returning to its caller.

The return value of `recover` is `nil` if any of the following conditions holds:

*   `panic`'s argument was `nil`;
*   the goroutine is not panicking;
*   `recover` was not called directly by a deferred function.

The `protect` function in the example below invokes the function argument `g` and protects callers from run-time panics raised by `g`.

func protect(g func()) {
	defer func() {
		log.Println("done")  // Println executes normally even if there is a panic
		if x := recover(); x != nil {
			log.Printf("run time panic: %v", x)
		}
	}()
	log.Println("start")
	g()
}

### Bootstrapping

Current implementations provide several built-in functions useful during bootstrapping. These functions are documented for completeness but are not guaranteed to stay in the language. They do not return a result.

Function   Behavior

print      prints all arguments; formatting of arguments is implementation-specific
println    like print but prints spaces between arguments and a newline at the end

Implementation restriction: `print` and `println` need not accept arbitrary argument types, but printing of boolean, numeric, and string [types](#Types) must be supported.

Packages
--------

Go programs are constructed by linking together _packages_. A package in turn is constructed from one or more source files that together declare constants, types, variables and functions belonging to the package and which are accessible in all files of the same package. Those elements may be [exported](#Exported_identifiers) and used in another package.

### Source file organization

Each source file consists of a package clause defining the package to which it belongs, followed by a possibly empty set of import declarations that declare packages whose contents it wishes to use, followed by a possibly empty set of declarations of functions, types, variables, and constants.

SourceFile       = [PackageClause](#PackageClause) ";" { [ImportDecl](#ImportDecl) ";" } { [TopLevelDecl](#TopLevelDecl) ";" } .

### Package clause

A package clause begins each source file and defines the package to which the file belongs.

PackageClause  = "package" [PackageName](#PackageName) .
PackageName    = [identifier](#identifier) .

The PackageName must not be the [blank identifier](#Blank_identifier).

package math

A set of files sharing the same PackageName form the implementation of a package. An implementation may require that all source files for a package inhabit the same directory.

### Import declarations

An import declaration states that the source file containing the declaration depends on functionality of the _imported_ package ([§Program initialization and execution](#Program_initialization_and_execution)) and enables access to [exported](#Exported_identifiers) identifiers of that package. The import names an identifier (PackageName) to be used for access and an ImportPath that specifies the package to be imported.

ImportDecl       = "import" ( [ImportSpec](#ImportSpec) | "(" { [ImportSpec](#ImportSpec) ";" } ")" ) .
ImportSpec       = \[ "." | [PackageName](#PackageName) \] [ImportPath](#ImportPath) .
ImportPath       = [string\_lit](#string_lit) .

The PackageName is used in [qualified identifiers](#Qualified_identifiers) to access exported identifiers of the package within the importing source file. It is declared in the [file block](#Blocks). If the PackageName is omitted, it defaults to the identifier specified in the [package clause](#Package_clause) of the imported package. If an explicit period (`.`) appears instead of a name, all the package's exported identifiers declared in that package's [package block](#Blocks) will be declared in the importing source file's file block and must be accessed without a qualifier.

The interpretation of the ImportPath is implementation-dependent but it is typically a substring of the full file name of the compiled package and may be relative to a repository of installed packages.

Implementation restriction: A compiler may restrict ImportPaths to non-empty strings using only characters belonging to [Unicode's](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.3.0/) L, M, N, P, and S general categories (the Graphic characters without spaces) and may also exclude the characters ``!"#$%&'()*,:;<=>?[\]^`{|}`` and the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD.

Assume we have compiled a package containing the package clause `package math`, which exports function `Sin`, and installed the compiled package in the file identified by `"lib/math"`. This table illustrates how `Sin` is accessed in files that import the package after the various types of import declaration.

Import declaration          Local name of Sin

import   "lib/math"         math.Sin
import m "lib/math"         m.Sin
import . "lib/math"         Sin

An import declaration declares a dependency relation between the importing and imported package. It is illegal for a package to import itself, directly or indirectly, or to directly import a package without referring to any of its exported identifiers. To import a package solely for its side-effects (initialization), use the [blank](#Blank_identifier) identifier as explicit package name:

import \_ "lib/math"

### An example package

Here is a complete Go package that implements a concurrent prime sieve.

package main

import "fmt"

// Send the sequence 2, 3, 4, … to channel 'ch'.
func generate(ch chan<- int) {
	for i := 2; ; i++ {
		ch <- i  // Send 'i' to channel 'ch'.
	}
}

// Copy the values from channel 'src' to channel 'dst',
// removing those divisible by 'prime'.
func filter(src <-chan int, dst chan<- int, prime int) {
	for i := range src {  // Loop over values received from 'src'.
		if i%prime != 0 {
			dst <- i  // Send 'i' to channel 'dst'.
		}
	}
}

// The prime sieve: Daisy-chain filter processes together.
func sieve() {
	ch := make(chan int)  // Create a new channel.
	go generate(ch)       // Start generate() as a subprocess.
	for {
		prime := <-ch
		fmt.Print(prime, "\\n")
		ch1 := make(chan int)
		go filter(ch, ch1, prime)
		ch = ch1
	}
}

func main() {
	sieve()
}

Program initialization and execution
------------------------------------

### The zero value

When storage is allocated for a [variable](#Variables), either through a declaration or a call of `new`, or when a new value is created, either through a composite literal or a call of `make`, and no explicit initialization is provided, the variable or value is given a default value. Each element of such a variable or value is set to the _zero value_ for its type: `false` for booleans, `0` for numeric types, `""` for strings, and `nil` for pointers, functions, interfaces, slices, channels, and maps. This initialization is done recursively, so for instance each element of an array of structs will have its fields zeroed if no value is specified.

These two simple declarations are equivalent:

var i int
var i int = 0

After

type T struct { i int; f float64; next \*T }
t := new(T)

the following holds:

t.i == 0
t.f == 0.0
t.next == nil

The same would also be true after

var t T

### Package initialization

Within a package, package-level variable initialization proceeds stepwise, with each step selecting the variable earliest in _declaration order_ which has no dependencies on uninitialized variables.

More precisely, a package-level variable is considered _ready for initialization_ if it is not yet initialized and either has no [initialization expression](#Variable_declarations) or its initialization expression has no _dependencies_ on uninitialized variables. Initialization proceeds by repeatedly initializing the next package-level variable that is earliest in declaration order and ready for initialization, until there are no variables ready for initialization.

If any variables are still uninitialized when this process ends, those variables are part of one or more initialization cycles, and the program is not valid.

Multiple variables on the left-hand side of a variable declaration initialized by single (multi-valued) expression on the right-hand side are initialized together: If any of the variables on the left-hand side is initialized, all those variables are initialized in the same step.

var x = a
var a, b = f() // a and b are initialized together, before x is initialized

For the purpose of package initialization, [blank](#Blank_identifier) variables are treated like any other variables in declarations.

The declaration order of variables declared in multiple files is determined by the order in which the files are presented to the compiler: Variables declared in the first file are declared before any of the variables declared in the second file, and so on.

Dependency analysis does not rely on the actual values of the variables, only on lexical _references_ to them in the source, analyzed transitively. For instance, if a variable `x`'s initialization expression refers to a function whose body refers to variable `y` then `x` depends on `y`. Specifically:

*   A reference to a variable or function is an identifier denoting that variable or function.
*   A reference to a method `m` is a [method value](#Method_values) or [method expression](#Method_expressions) of the form `t.m`, where the (static) type of `t` is not an interface type, and the method `m` is in the [method set](#Method_sets) of `t`. It is immaterial whether the resulting function value `t.m` is invoked.
*   A variable, function, or method `x` depends on a variable `y` if `x`'s initialization expression or body (for functions and methods) contains a reference to `y` or to a function or method that depends on `y`.

For example, given the declarations

var (
	a = c + b  // == 9
	b = f()    // == 4
	c = f()    // == 5
	d = 3      // == 5 after initialization has finished
)

func f() int {
	d++
	return d
}

the initialization order is `d`, `b`, `c`, `a`. Note that the order of subexpressions in initialization expressions is irrelevant: `a = c + b` and `a = b + c` result in the same initialization order in this example.

Dependency analysis is performed per package; only references referring to variables, functions, and (non-interface) methods declared in the current package are considered. If other, hidden, data dependencies exists between variables, the initialization order between those variables is unspecified.

For instance, given the declarations

var x = I(T{}).ab()   // x has an undetected, hidden dependency on a and b
var \_ = sideEffect()  // unrelated to x, a, or b
var a = b
var b = 42

type I interface      { ab() \[\]int }
type T struct{}
func (T) ab() \[\]int   { return \[\]int{a, b} }

the variable `a` will be initialized after `b` but whether `x` is initialized before `b`, between `b` and `a`, or after `a`, and thus also the moment at which `sideEffect()` is called (before or after `x` is initialized) is not specified.

Variables may also be initialized using functions named `init` declared in the package block, with no arguments and no result parameters.

func init() { … }

Multiple such functions may be defined per package, even within a single source file. In the package block, the `init` identifier can be used only to declare `init` functions, yet the identifier itself is not [declared](#Declarations_and_scope). Thus `init` functions cannot be referred to from anywhere in a program.

A package with no imports is initialized by assigning initial values to all its package-level variables followed by calling all `init` functions in the order they appear in the source, possibly in multiple files, as presented to the compiler. If a package has imports, the imported packages are initialized before initializing the package itself. If multiple packages import a package, the imported package will be initialized only once. The importing of packages, by construction, guarantees that there can be no cyclic initialization dependencies.

Package initialization—variable initialization and the invocation of `init` functions—happens in a single goroutine, sequentially, one package at a time. An `init` function may launch other goroutines, which can run concurrently with the initialization code. However, initialization always sequences the `init` functions: it will not invoke the next one until the previous one has returned.

To ensure reproducible initialization behavior, build systems are encouraged to present multiple files belonging to the same package in lexical file name order to a compiler.

### Program execution

A complete program is created by linking a single, unimported package called the _main package_ with all the packages it imports, transitively. The main package must have package name `main` and declare a function `main` that takes no arguments and returns no value.

func main() { … }

Program execution begins by initializing the main package and then invoking the function `main`. When that function invocation returns, the program exits. It does not wait for other (non-`main`) goroutines to complete.

Errors
------

The predeclared type `error` is defined as

type error interface {
	Error() string
}

It is the conventional interface for representing an error condition, with the nil value representing no error. For instance, a function to read data from a file might be defined:

func Read(f \*File, b \[\]byte) (n int, err error)

Run-time panics
---------------

Execution errors such as attempting to index an array out of bounds trigger a _run-time panic_ equivalent to a call of the built-in function [`panic`](#Handling_panics) with a value of the implementation-defined interface type `runtime.Error`. That type satisfies the predeclared interface type [`error`](#Errors). The exact error values that represent distinct run-time error conditions are unspecified.

package runtime

type Error interface {
	error
	// and perhaps other methods
}

System considerations
---------------------

### Package `unsafe`

The built-in package `unsafe`, known to the compiler and accessible through the [import path](#Import_declarations) `"unsafe"`, provides facilities for low-level programming including operations that violate the type system. A package using `unsafe` must be vetted manually for type safety and may not be portable. The package provides the following interface:

package unsafe

type ArbitraryType int  // shorthand for an arbitrary Go type; it is not a real type
type Pointer \*ArbitraryType

func Alignof(variable ArbitraryType) uintptr
func Offsetof(selector ArbitraryType) uintptr
func Sizeof(variable ArbitraryType) uintptr

type IntegerType int  // shorthand for an integer type; it is not a real type
func Add(ptr Pointer, len IntegerType) Pointer
func Slice(ptr \*ArbitraryType, len IntegerType) \[\]ArbitraryType

A `Pointer` is a [pointer type](#Pointer_types) but a `Pointer` value may not be [dereferenced](#Address_operators). Any pointer or value of [underlying type](#Types) `uintptr` can be [converted](#Conversions) to a type of underlying type `Pointer` and vice versa. The effect of converting between `Pointer` and `uintptr` is implementation-defined.

var f float64
bits = \*(\*uint64)(unsafe.Pointer(&f))

type ptr unsafe.Pointer
bits = \*(\*uint64)(ptr(&f))

var p ptr = nil

The functions `Alignof` and `Sizeof` take an expression `x` of any type and return the alignment or size, respectively, of a hypothetical variable `v` as if `v` was declared via `var v = x`.

The function `Offsetof` takes a (possibly parenthesized) [selector](#Selectors) `s.f`, denoting a field `f` of the struct denoted by `s` or `*s`, and returns the field offset in bytes relative to the struct's address. If `f` is an [embedded field](#Struct_types), it must be reachable without pointer indirections through fields of the struct. For a struct `s` with field `f`:

uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&s)) + unsafe.Offsetof(s.f) == uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&s.f))

Computer architectures may require memory addresses to be _aligned_; that is, for addresses of a variable to be a multiple of a factor, the variable's type's _alignment_. The function `Alignof` takes an expression denoting a variable of any type and returns the alignment of the (type of the) variable in bytes. For a variable `x`:

uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&x)) % unsafe.Alignof(x) == 0

A (variable of) type `T` has _variable size_ if `T` is a [type parameter](#Type_parameter_declarations), or if it is an array or struct type containing elements or fields of variable size. Otherwise the size is _constant_. Calls to `Alignof`, `Offsetof`, and `Sizeof` are compile-time [constant expressions](#Constant_expressions) of type `uintptr` if their arguments (or the struct `s` in the selector expression `s.f` for `Offsetof`) are types of constant size.

The function `Add` adds `len` to `ptr` and returns the updated pointer `unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(ptr) + uintptr(len))`. The `len` argument must be of [integer type](#Numeric_types) or an untyped [constant](#Constants). A constant `len` argument must be [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `int`; if it is an untyped constant it is given type `int`. The rules for [valid uses](/pkg/unsafe#Pointer) of `Pointer` still apply.

The function `Slice` returns a slice whose underlying array starts at `ptr` and whose length and capacity are `len`. `Slice(ptr, len)` is equivalent to

(\*\[len\]ArbitraryType)(unsafe.Pointer(ptr))\[:\]

except that, as a special case, if `ptr` is `nil` and `len` is zero, `Slice` returns `nil`.

The `len` argument must be of [integer type](#Numeric_types) or an untyped [constant](#Constants). A constant `len` argument must be non-negative and [representable](#Representability) by a value of type `int`; if it is an untyped constant it is given type `int`. At run time, if `len` is negative, or if `ptr` is `nil` and `len` is not zero, a [run-time panic](#Run_time_panics) occurs.

### Size and alignment guarantees

For the [numeric types](#Numeric_types), the following sizes are guaranteed:

type                                 size in bytes

byte, uint8, int8                     1
uint16, int16                         2
uint32, int32, float32                4
uint64, int64, float64, complex64     8
complex128                           16

The following minimal alignment properties are guaranteed:

1.  For a variable `x` of any type: `unsafe.Alignof(x)` is at least 1.
2.  For a variable `x` of struct type: `unsafe.Alignof(x)` is the largest of all the values `unsafe.Alignof(x.f)` for each field `f` of `x`, but at least 1.
3.  For a variable `x` of array type: `unsafe.Alignof(x)` is the same as the alignment of a variable of the array's element type.

A struct or array type has size zero if it contains no fields (or elements, respectively) that have a size greater than zero. Two distinct zero-size variables may have the same address in memory.
